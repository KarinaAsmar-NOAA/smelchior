( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)

 Model Script file changes:
   excdas_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Modifed to enable the dumping of 002017 component of vadwnd dump
      group.
      BENEFIT: SCN 21-96 disabled "NEXRAD Vel Azm Dsp(VAD) winds via radar
               coded msg" (b002/xx008) data. In order to continue processing 
               global vadwnd dump files, the processing of "NEXRAD Vel Azm 
               Dsp(VAD) winds via Level 2 decoder" (b002017) data needs to
               be enabled. This will allow for vadwnd data to continue to be
               available for cdas processing.

 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JCDAS_DUMP:
    - As a result of updates to excdas_dump.sh.ecf:
       $COMROOT/cdas/prod/cdas.YYYYMMDD/cdas.tCCz.vadwnd.tm00.bufr_d,
       will contain observations from the "NEXRAD Vel Azm Dsp (VAD) winds
       via Level 2 deocder (002017) subset. These data are higher volume,
       resulting in each cycle's vadwnd bufr_d file being larger than 
       current operations by ~ 1 Mb. 

 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
    - No change in requested resources in the job cards.
    - Negligible change in memory usage.
    - Negligible change in wall clock time.

    - Disabled the dumping of radwnd data.
    - Disabled the copy of snow and sst grb data from dcom to com.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
    - If current production resources in job cards remain
      unchanged for JCDAS_DUMP, the process runs ~60s slower
      on Dell.  It is posposed that the requested resources
      in the job cards increase from 3 to 4 for: 
      #BSUB -R "span[ptile=4]"
      #BSUB -n 4
      BENEFIT: This adjustment results in JCDAS_DUMP running
      ~ 98s faster on Dell.
    - No change in requested resources in the job cards for
      JCDAS_DUMP_POST, JCDAS_PREP1, JCDAS_PREP1_POST,
      JCDAS_PREP2, and JCDAS_PREP2_POST.
    - JCDAS_DUMP runs        ~98s faster on Dell (after card changes)
    - JCDAS_DUMP_POST runs   ~ 5s faster on Dell
    - JCDAS_PREP1 runs       ~ 5s slower on Dell
    - JCDAS_PREP1_POST runs  ~ 5s slower on Dell
    - JCDAS_PREP2 runs       ~12s faster on Dell
    - JCDAS_PREP2_POST runs  ~ 5s slower on Dell

 JOB script changes:
   All job scripts:
    - Use variable $RUN rather than $model to set the default COMIN and COMOUT
      directory basenames. This allows NCO to use "$model" to reference the
      "obsproc_cdas" package in ecflow scripts (per recent practice).
    - Added call of err_exit if the driver script returns a non-zero status.
   JCDAS_DUMP:
     - Updated default NWROOT location to find obsproc_dump on phase 2 disk.
     - Changed variable BACK to be expandable with default value of "off" which
       disables background threads in dumpjb. (was hard-coded as "on")
     - Added variable MPMD with default setting of "off" (used in dumpjb)
     - Added variable launcher with default setting of "cfp" to use that utility
       to process multiple dump groups simultaneously in excdas_dump.sh.ecf.
   JCDAS_DUMP_POST, JCDAS_PREP1_POST, JCDAS_PREP2_POST:
     - Updated default NWROOT location to find bufr_remorest on phase 2 disk.
   JCDAS_PREP2:
     - Removed load of util_shared module. (not needed with newer obsproc_prep)

 Model script changes:
   excdas_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Replaced use of background threads with cfp for simultaneous dump group
      processing. (dump groups will be processed serially if anything other than
      "cfp" is passed in for variable launcher)
   excdas_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf:
    - Use variable $RUN rather than $model when referencing input directories
      (as noted above for all job scripts)


 Output changes:
 ---------------

   Job JCDAS_DUMP_POST:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v3.1.0:
       - Listings for "msonet" dumps will include SDM quality marks.
       - Some printed float values will no longer include a leading zero.

 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JCDAS_DUMP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.4.0:
       - Dump files
         /com/cdas/prod/cdas.<yyyymmdd>/cdas.t<cc>z.aircft.tm00.bufr_d
         now contain Korean AMDAR (BUFR), AMDAR-catchall (BUFR), and Panasonic
         (AirDAT) TAMDAR (BUFR) reports from b004/xx010, b004/xx011 and
         b004/x103 tanks, resp. In cases where AMDAR-catchall (BUFR)
         (b004/xx103) reports duplicate TAC-feed AMDAR (b004/xx003) reports, the
         former will be retained.
   Job JCDAS_PREP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.4.0:
       - Korean AMDAR (BUFR) and AMDAR-catchall (BUFR) reports now excoded into
         PREPBUFR files (type 131/231) and will be available for assimilation.
         Panasonic (AirDAT) TAMDAR (BUFR) reports are not encoded into PREPBUFR
         files.

 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v7.1.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of:
      v2.2.0 of obsproc_dump_monitor,
      v3.1.0 of obsproc_nam,
      v2.4.0 of obsproc_rap,
      v1.4.0 of obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
obsproc_cdas release 2.2.0 --> released Jan 12, 2017
                           --> implemented Feb 21, 2017

 M obsproc_cdas/scripts/excdas_dump.sh.ecf

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   All job scripts:
    - Move check that required variables are set to top of script.
    - Revised logic that generates version informational output at the start of
      the job for cleaner script and output.
   JCDAS_DUMP:
    - Set default for new script variable $KEEP_NEARDUP_ACFT to "NO" to ensure
      that near-duplicate aircraft reports will not be retained.
      BENEFIT: The CDAS analysis will continue to process aircraft data in the
               same manner as before.  No change is good for the CDAS!
   JCDAS_PREP1:
    - Minor comment change.

 Model script changes:
   excdas_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Removed temporary logic added in v2.3.0 which changed "gpsipw" dump file's
      group to "rstprod" and its permission to "640" so that it could only be
      read by users in the rstprod group.  This is no longer needed since
      "gpsipw" has now been added to the list of dump files for which this needs
      to be done in obsproc_dump.v3.3.0 which is being implemented
      simultaneously with obsproc_cdas.v2.2.0.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepdata.cdas.parm:
    - The default overrides for AWINDO, JAMASS, JAWIND, IACFTL, AIFNOW and
      FLACMS are extended to accommodate three additional aircraft data types:
      Korean AMDAR (BUFR), AMDAR-catchall (BUFR) and Panasonic (AirDAT) TAMDAR
      (BUFR).  There were six, now there are nine.  The two new AMDAR types will
      get the same values as previously existing AMDAR types in type 131/231 and
      will be processed and included in the PREPBUFR files if found in the
      "aircft" dump files. The new TAMDAR type will get the same values as the
      previously existing TAMDAR type (MADIS) and will not be processed and thus
      not included in the PREPBUFR files even if found in the "aircft" dump
      files.
      (Note: Canadian AMDAR aircraft mass and wind data, which are found in the
             "aircft" dump files, continue to be turned off from processing
             since they would be encoded into report types 133/235 which are not
             recognized by the CDAS analysis.)
      BENEFIT: Korean AMDAR (BUFR) and AMDAR-catchall (BUFR) will be available
               for assimilation by the CDAS once found in "aircft" dump files
               (they are not yet there).


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JCDAS_DUMP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump.v3.3.0:
       - Mesonet (msonet) dump files can now contain reports with purged/
         rejected QMs on p,t,q,uv.
    - After ARINC switches to v7 BUFR for AMDAR and MDCRS, dump files
      /com/cdas/prod/cdas.$PDY/cdas.t${cyc}z.aircar.tm00.bufr_d
      (where cyc= 00, 06, 12, 18) can potentially store lat/lon (CLAT/CLON) to
      10**5 precision.
   Job JCDAS_DUMP_POST:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v2.3.0:
       - Listings for "aircft", "aircar", "adpupa", "adpsfc", "sfcshp",
         "msonet", "ascatw" and "gpsipw" dumps now print lat/lon out to 0.00001
         degree (although actual significance is still based on precision in the
         BUFR lat/lon encoded in each dump file).
   Job JCDAS_PREP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.8.0:
       - E-AMDAR moisture now excoded into PREPBUFR files (flagged here, not
         considered by assimilation).
       - PREPBUFR files now store lat/lon (YOB/XOB) to 10**5 precision, this
         will potentially be seen for the following types: AIRCFT 131/231
         E-AMDAR (only), AIRCAR 133/233 (MDCRS) (after ARINC switches to v7 BUFR
         for AMDAR and MDCRS).

    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.8.0:
       - program prepobs_prepacqc uses more memory due to an increase in array
         parameter MAXFLT and now passing double-precision latitude/longitude:
               previous: The maximum resident set size (KB) = 1365088
               now:      The maximum resident set size (KB) = 1369196

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   All JOB scripts:
    - Use NCO-established variables to point to root directories for main
      software components and input/output directories in order to run on
      WCOSS Phase 1 or Phase 2.  (Some util* variables remain and point to
      /nwprod/util as required by obsproc application scripts).
    - Use NCO-established variables to point to prod and grib utilities.
    - Execute "module list" to echo "Currently Loaded Modulefiles" to stdout.
    - Removed direct path to setpdy.sh utility script, relying on version
      added to PATH (presumably by prod_util module).  Echo full path to this
      script to stdout.
    - Use new NCO standard variable KEEPDATA in place of CLEANUP to decide
      whether to remove working directory at end of run.
    - Removed NCO vs developer checks in places were we could rely on
      variables
      set in ecflow environment for NCO runs. Modified remaining such wrappers
      to check setting of NCO standard variable RUN_ENVIR in place of
      non-standard variables used previously.
    - Revised logic that generates version informational output at the start of
      the job for cleaner script and output.
   JCDAS_DUMP:
    - Obtains version number for module grib_util via imported environment
      variable $grib_util_ver.  This is defined in the upstream ecflow script.
      Current setting is grib_util_ver=v1.0.1.
       - Load module grib_util/v1.0.1.
      BENEFIT: Defines path now relied on to run utility program grbindex in
               model script excdas_dump.sh.ecf and in ush script
               bufr_dump_obs.sh.
    - Moved logic to copy files to arkv directory from here to model script
      excdas_dump.sh.ecf. New script variable controlling this, $COPY_TO_ARKV,
      defaults to "YES" here (and only when it is "YES" is the target directory
      path $COMARC now set here).
   JCDAS_PREP1, JCDAS_PREP2:
    - Moved logic to copy files to arkv directory from here to model script
      excdas_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf. New script variable $COMARC, the target
      directory path, is set here (when script variable controlling copy to
      arkv directory, $COPY_TO_ARKV is "YES") such that it can write to output
      directory on either WCOSS Phase 1 or Phase 2, with a NCO vs developer
      check wrapper.
   JCDAS_PREP1, JCDAS_PREP1_POST, JCDAS_PREP2, JCDAS_PREP2_POST:
    - Set new script variable $JOB_NUMBER (1 for PREP1 & PREP1_POST jobs, 2 for
      PREP2 & PREP2_POST jobs).  For PREP jobs, used by model script
      excdas_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf to determine what files should be copied to
      arkv directory.
   JCDAS_PREP2:
    - Obtains version number for module util_shared via imported environment
      variable $util_shared_ver.  This is defined in the upstream ecflow script.
      Current setting is util_shared_ver=v1.0.4.
       - Load module util_shared/v1.0.4.
      BENEFIT: Defines prepended path now relied on to run utility ush
               getges.sh in ush script prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh.
    - New script variable $COM_IN, the path to past and future PREPBUFR files
      possibly read by program prepobs_cqcbufr which is ultimately executed out
      of model script excdas_makeprepbufr.sh, is set here such that it can run
      on either WCOSS Phase 1 or Phase 2, with a NCO vs developer check
      wrapper.
      BENEFIT: The previous path to these PREPBUFR files, $COM1, was
               inadvertently not exported to excdas_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf. This
               prevented the CQCBUFR temporal check from running in the CDAS
               network (the only network where it currently would run). This QC
               check now runs in the CDAS PREP2 jobs.

 Model script changes:
   excdas_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Use NCO standard variables to point to grib utilities.
    - Replaced "/com" with full file name path beginning with ${COMSP} in
      messages posted to jlogfile when copying 0.5 degree snow grib file, T574
      snow grib file, engice grib file and sst grib file.
      BENEFIT: Adds more information, generalizes for current and future prod
               i/o (/com and /com2, resp.).
    - Moved logic to copy files to arkv directory here (had been in job
      script JCDAS_DUMP).  Controlled by new script variable $COPY_TO_ARKV set
      in job script. Copy preserves ownership & group id but updates timestamp.
      BENEFIT: Logic such as this should not be in job script.
    - Added temporary logic to change "gpsipw" dump file's group to "rstprod"
      and its permission to "640" so that it can only be read by users in the
      rstprod group.
      BENEFIT: New "gpsipw" dump file is restricted.  The logic to restrict dump
               files is done in obsproc_dump ush script bufr_dump_obs.sh, where
               the list of files to restrict is hardwired.  Since obsproc_dump
               is not included in this release bundle, the restriction must be
               done here.  This temporary logic will be removed once a future
               change to add "gpsipw" to the list of dump files to restrict is
               made in the next obsproc_dump release.
   excdas_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf:
    - Replaced script variable $COM1 with $COM_IN which is a directory path to
      past and future PREPBUFR files possibly read by program prepobs_cqcbufr
      which is ultimately executed out of this script.
      BENEFIT: See change to job script JCDAS_PREP2 above.
    - Replace hard path to ndate utility with NCO standard variable $NDATE.
    - Moved logic to copy files to arkv directory here (had been in job
      scripts JCDAS_PREP1 and JCDAS_PREP2).  Controlled by new script variable
      $COPY_TO_ARKV set in job script. New script variable $JOB_NUMBER (1 for
      PREP1 job, 2 for PREP2 job, set in job script) determines what should be
      copied.  Copy preserves ownership & group id but updates timestamp.
      BENEFIT: Logic such as this should not be in job script. PREPBUFR files
               now have correct group id "rstprod" rather than "prod".


 Output changes:
 ---------------

obsproc_cdas release 2.0.4 --> released May 1, 2015
                           --> implemented Aug 10, 2015

files:
 M obsproc_cdas/parm/prepobs_prepdata.cdas.parm
 M obsproc_cdas/scripts/excdas_dump.sh.ecf

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 Model script changes:
   excdas_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Dump window for GOES satwnd types from tanks NC005010 (IR/LW), NC005011
      (WV/IMGR) and NC005012 (VIZ) changed from -1.00 to -0.01 hours about
      center dump time to -3.00 to +2.99 hours about center dump time.
      BENEFIT:  Allows all possible GOES satwnds to be dumped throughout the
                day in this late (archive) network.
    - Dump window for new satwnd types NC005019 (GOES IR/SW), NC005080 (POES
      AVHRR) and NC005090 (POES VIIRS) specified to be -3.00 to +2.99 hours
      about center dump time.
      BENEFIT:  Allows all of these new satwnd types to be dumped throughout
                the day in this late (archive) network.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepdata.cdas.parm:
    - The time window for processing high-density IR/LW, VIZ, WV/IMGR cloud-top
      and WV/IMGR deep-layer GOES satwnds into the CDAS PREPBUFR file is
      changed from -1.50 hours to +1.50 hours about PREPBUFR center time to
      -1.00 to -0.01 hours about PREPBUFR center time.
      BENEFIT:  This results in no net change in the number of these winds in
                the CDAS PREPBUFR file (and thus the number available to the
                CDAS analysis) even though the dump time-window for these types
                has been widened as noted above.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JCDAS_DUMP:
    - The "satwnd" dumps will contain ~6 times as many GOES IR/LW, GOES WV/IMGR
      and GOES VIZ winds as before.
    - As a result of update to obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.2.0:
       - The "satwnd" dump files will contain GOES IR/SW, POES AVHRR/IR/LW and
         POES VIIRS/IR/LW winds.
   Job JCDAS_PREP1:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.5.0:
       - Valid TSB values will be encoded into PREPBUFR file for reports in
         message type AIRCAR.
       - Marine reports previously, incorrectly deemed over land and flagged
         will now be deemed over water and be available for assimilation.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Job JCDAS_PREP2:
    - No change in requested resources in the job cards.
    - program prepobs_prepacqc now uses more memory due to an increase in
      array parameter "max_reps":
            previous: The maximum resident set size (KB) = 1024368
            now:      The maximum resident set size (KB) = 1366072
    - No other changes to memory usage.
    - A couple of seconds increase in wallclock run time.
   All other jobs:
    - No change in requested resources in the job cards.
    - No change to memory usage.
    - No change in wallclock run time.

 JOB script changes:
   All JOB scripts:
    - Splits CDAS network into new obsproc_cdas directory.  GFS and GDAS
      networks remain in obsproc_global.directory.
       - Obtain obsproc_cdas version number via imported environment variable
         $obsproc_cdas_ver.  This is defined in the upstream ecflow script.
         (Replaces obsproc_global environment variable $obsproc_global_ver.)
         In production, environment variable $HOMEobsproc_network is now set to
         /nwprod/obsproc_cdas.$obsproc_cdas_ver (had been set to
         /nwprod/obsproc_global.$obsproc_global_ver). 
      BENEFIT: Allows more flexibility in making changes to just the CDAS which
               is a fundamentally different system than the GFS/GDAS.
   JCDAS_DUMP:
    - Remove reference to TRMM in comments.

 Model script changes:
   excdas_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Copy of obsproc_global.v2.0.2/scripts/exglobal_dump.sh.ecf and then
      updated to exclusively handle the CDAS network.            
    - Specific CDAS differences from
      obsproc_global.v2.0.2/scripts/exglobal_dump.sh.ecf:
       - No longer dumps TRMM data.  (These data are not assimilated. Ingest
         will soon be discontinued as the satellite is nearing end of life.)
   excdas_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf:
    - Copy of obsproc_global.v2.0.2/scripts/exglobal_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf and
      then updated to exclusively handle the CDAS network.            

 Fixed file changes:
   All fixed files:
    - No changes to contents.

 Parm file changes:
   All parm files:
    - No changes to contents.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JCDAS_DUMP:
    - Dump files "trmm" and "sptrmm" will no longer be present in
      /com/cdas/prod/... directories.
   Jobs JCDAS_PREP1, JCDAS_PREP2:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.4.0:
       - Reports in PREPBUFR file, message type SATEMP will now be from the
         primary POES constellation NOAA-19 ("SAID" 223) and METOP-1(B)
         ("SAID" 3) rather than from the secondary POES constellation NOAA-18
         ("SAID" 209) and METOP-2(A) (which was incorrectly identified as
         "SAID" 210 instead of "SAID" 4).
