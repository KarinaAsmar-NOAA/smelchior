( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted) 


 Model script changes:
   exrap_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Modified dump group 3 subtype counts to keep aligned with the
      updated bufr_dumplist at v2.4.0.
      BENEFIT: sfcshp dump file includes BUFR format ships and cman data.
    - Modified dump group 3 to generate a separate tideg dump file, no
      longer included in the sfcshp dump file.
      BENEFIT: Eliminates duplicate reports complications between the
               two separate data streams: tideg and cmanb.
    - Added logic to copy bufr_dumplist file to $COMOUT.
      BENEFIT: per NCO SPA request.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP:
    - As a result of updates to exrap_dump.sh.ecf:

          $COMROOThps/rap/prod/rap*.YYYYMMDD/rap*.tCCz.sfcshp.tm00.bufr_d,
         will have the tideg subset (NC001005) removed.
       - The tideg dump file,
          $COMROOThps/rap/prod/rap*.YYYYMMDD/rap*.tCCz.tideg.tm00.bufr_d,
         will be new.
    - As a result of updates in obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v2.4.0:

files:
 M obsproc_rap/jobs/JRAP_PREP

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted) 


 JOB script changes:
   JRAP_PREP
    - Modified to use the new $COMPONENT subdirectory structure.
    - Modified to integrate the NETCDF_IN switch for encoding the
      first guess information into the prepbufr file.
      BENEFIT: Needed to work correctly with the GFS v16 upgrade.
    - To run on Cray with obsproc_prep.v5.4.0:
      - export POE=NO
      - load module NetCDF-intel-sandybridge/4.7.4 at runtime
        (otherwise the guess file is not recognized as NetCDF)
      - set default of NSPLIT=1 and POE=NO because the Cray nodes
        cannot handle more than 1 instance of prepobs_prepdata when
        reading GFSv16 forecast files.  This substantially increases
        run time.  See section: Compute Resource Information.

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted) 



 JOB script changes:
   JRAP_DUMP
    - Disabled processing for early HRRR.  No longer required for
      HRRRv4.


 Model script changes:
   exrap_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Added ability to dump gsrasr and gsrcsr data via the
      introduction of a new dump group, #8.
      BENEFIT: GOES-16 All-sky and Clear-sky Radiance data are
      available for RAPv5.
    - Updated dump group #2 member, satwnd, to add 5 tanks:
      005030, 005031, 005032, 005034, 005039.  These tanks
      contain GOES-16/-17 DMW data.
      BENEFIT: GOES-16/-17 DMW data will be available for RAPv5.
    - Updated dump group #2 member, satwnd, to skip the
      GOES-15 tanks in the dump group: 005010, 005011,
      005012, 005019.  GOES-15 data ceased on 3/2/2020.
      BENEFIT: exrap_dump.sh.ecf will no longer attempt to read
      from tanks that no longer exist.
    - Updated dump group #2 member, satwnd, to establish new
      DTIM settings for the new EUMETSAT tanks: 005067, 005068,
      005069. The legacy tanks (005064, 005065, 006066) are replaced
      by the new WMO BUFR sequence 93-10-077) tanks on Oct 6, 2020.
      Settings are in place to skip processing the legacy
      format EUMETSAT AMV subsets.
    - Removed radwnd from dump group #2.  These data are no
      longer available from the data provider.
    - Removed goesnd from dump group #5.  These data are no longer
      available following the storage of GOES-15.
    - Added new member to dump group #7: crisf4
      BENEFIT: NPP and NOAA-20 CrIS FSR data will be available
               for RAPv5.
    - Renamed and/or removed members in dump group #7: crisdb and escris
      BENEFIT: crisdb is renamed to crsfdb and escris is removed
               in response to the cessation of NSR CrIS data from
               NPP on April 22, 2020.  FSR CrIS data from NPP is the 
               replacement.
    - Moved lghtng to unique new dump group, #9.  Removed lghtng from 
      dump group #7.
      BENEFIT: allows for the lghtning bufr_d file to be completed a
               little bit earlier to minimize delay for HRRR.
    - Disabled processing for early HRRR.  No longer required for
      HRRRv4.
    - Removed the setting to skip processing NPN profiler data
      now that obsproc_rap is using a bufr_dumplist that removes
      the NPN tank (002007) from the proflr definition.
    - Added DBN alerts for all satellite data products, per GSL 
      (formerly GSD) request.
    - Changed background threads to serial threads.

   - Test all four production jobs for full-cycle, partial-cycle, early RAP
     and early HRRR.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   - The main users of this output are the RAP full-cycle, partial-cycle and
     early networks, and the HRRR network.  (HRRR users should not be impacted
     by this upgrade)
   - No change in dissemination.
   - No change in archival on HPSS


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v11.0.0.
   This must be implemented either simultaneously with or after the
   implementation of:
      v5.2.0 of obsproc_prep.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementation of:
      v3.2.0 of obsproc_global,
      v3.3.0 of obsproc_nam.
   This should be implemented on WCOSS Cray.

   Please retrieve obsproc_rap.ver file:

 M obsproc_rap/jobs/JRAP_PREP_POST
 M obsproc_rap/scripts/exrap_dump.sh.ecf

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)

 JOB script changes:
   All job scripts:
    - Added shebang to use /bin/bash interpreter
    - Reorganized to set execution trace prompt string (PS4) closer to the top
    - Added Module package initialization so that the module function can be
      found to list currently loaded modules when running on luna and surge
      (which currently use a setup that does not export the module function to
      child scripts)
    - Made variable jobid expandable to preserve the setting exported from NCO
      wrapper scripts.
    - Explicitly copy needed prod utils to the working directory (in place
      of old setup.sh)
    - Added call of err_exit if the driver script returns a non-zero status.
   JRAP_DUMP:
    - Removed load of grib_util module (latest preferred practice is to load
      modules in the parent environment).
   JRAP_DUMP_POST:
    - Use new directory $COMROOT/rap/$envir/sdm_rtdm to hold obcount_30day and
      avgdata directories which contain dump status info to help the SDM
      monitor changes in data counts.
   JRAP_PREP:
    - Use variable $NWROOTp1 to find decoder dictionary directory.
    - Removed NPROCS.  (This variable is now set if needed in obsproc_prep)

 Model script changes:
   exrap_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Run under ksh.  Necessary on luna and surge in order to create here-docs
      if variable TMPDIR was imported in an lsf job.
    - Added logic to determine if running on Cray-XC40 or IBM iDataPlex.
    - Added 6 new data tanks to dump group #1: esiasi, iasidb, esatms, atmsdb,
      sevasr, amsr2.
    - Added 3 new data tanks to dump group #7: escris, crisdb, saphir.
    - Copy grib2 format imssnow file.
    - Expanded lghtng dump window.
    - Added temporary setting to skip processing tank 002007 until next
      bufr_dumplist upgrade.

 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP:
    - 9 new dump files are generated for every cycle.
    - An additional imssnow file is present for every cycle.

 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------

      production).
    - JRAP_PREP all cycles: runs take ~185s (~53s longer than current
      production).
    - JRAP_PREP_POST all cycles: runs take ~21s (~7s longer than current
      production).

files:
 M obsproc_rap/scripts/exrap_dump.sh.ecf

 Model script changes:

obsproc_rap release 2.5.0 --> released Apr 28, 2017
                          --> implemented Jul 19, 2017

files added, modified or deleted with this release:
 M obsproc_rap/jobs/JRAP_PREP

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)

 JOB script changes:
   JRAP_PREP:
    - Added new variable NEMSIO_IN with default setting of ".true." to tell
      obsproc_prep software whether to process nemsio global forecast files
      instead of the older sigio files.
    - Added variables COMINgdas and COMINgfs needed by the version of getges.sh
      used for NEMSIO_IN=.true. (available in obsproc_prep.v4.0.0).
    - Added variable envir_getges with default of "prod".
    - Added wrapper around GETGES_NWG and GETGES_COM variables for the pre- and
      post- GFS upgrade transitional period.
    - Removed load of the util_shared module which is no longer needed with the
      upgrade to obsproc_prep.v4.0.0.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JRAP_PREP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v4.0.0:
       - rap prepbufr files will have quality marks applied for more VADWND
         and PROFLR stations due to increases in the max number of stations
         that can be qc'd in prepobs_cqcvad and prepobs_profcqc, respectively.
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v4.0.0 with NEMSIO_IN=.true.:
       - for any run, no matter the cycle, a single global forecast file valid
         at the same hour will be used to provide background information.
         (Previously, that was true only for cycles at hours that are a multiple
         of three.  Two 3-hrly forecast files valid at surrounding hours were
         used for other cycles).  Thus, file rap*.t??z.sgesprep.tm00 will be
         output for all cycles and files rap*.t??z.sgesprep_before.tm00 and
         rap*.t??z.sgesprep_after.tm00 will no longer be created for any cycle.
       - the global forecast files copied to rap*.t??z.sgesprep.tm00 will change
         from spectral coordinate (sigio) to gridded fields (nemsio) and will
         increase in size from ~3.5Gb to ~7Gb.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Job JRAP_PREP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
      - The max memory increases to ~53Gb, but no change in job cards
        is required because these jobs already run exclusively on IBM-P2 nodes.
      - In developer testing, run times were reduced by ~10 seconds for cycle
        hours that are a multiple of three and ~35 seconds for other hours.


 Disk Space Changes:
 -------------------
   /com2/rap/prod/rap.    - Increase ~28 Gb per day
   /com2/rap/prod/rap_e.  - Increase  ~7 Gb per day
   /com2/rap/prod/rap_p.  - Increase ~14 Gb per day

 Dissemination:
 --------------
   - The main users of this output are the RAP full-cycle, partial-cycle and
     early networks, and the HRRR network.  (HRRR users should not be impacted
     by this upgrade)
   - No change in dissemination.
   - No change in archival on HPSS outside of changes to /com2 noted previously.


 Special Instructions:

 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.4.0:
       - Dump files
         /com2/rap/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$RUN.t${cyc}z.aircft.tm00.bufr_d
         now contain  Korean AMDAR (BUFR), AMDAR-catchall (BUFR), and Panasonic
         (AirDAT) TAMDAR (BUFR) reports from b004/xx010, b004/xx011 and
         b004/x103 tanks, resp. In cases where AMDAR-catchall (BUFR)
         (b004/xx103) reports duplicate TAC-feed AMDAR (b004/xx003) reports, the
         former will be retained.
       - "TMDARA" [TAMDAR aircraft data-all types (from Panasonic, decoded from
         BUFR)], "KAMDAR" [Korean AMDAR aircraft data (decoded from BUFR)], and
         "AMDARB" [AMDAR aircraft data (decoded from BUFR)] will now appear in

 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v7.1.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of:

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   All job scripts:
    - Move check that required variables are set to top of script.
    - Revised logic that generates version informational output at the start of
      the job for cleaner script and output.
   JRAP_DUMP:
    - Set default for new script variable $KEEP_NEARDUP_ACFT to "NO" to ensure
      that near-duplicate aircraft reports will not be retained.
      BENEFIT: Testing has shown that the inclusion of these near-duplicate
               aircraft reports degrades the GFS forecast five days out.  It
               is uncertain what the affect is on the RAP forecast but more
               testing is needed to ensure that it too won't be degraded at some
               point in the forecast.  The GSI may need to be updated to include
               thinning of aircraft reports before the near-duplicate aircraft
               reports can be introduced.  This switch will allow for an easy
               change to include these data at some future time.
   JRAP_PREP:
    - Minor comment change.

 Model script changes:
   exrap_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Removed temporary logic added in v2.3.0 which changed "gpsipw" dump file's
      group to "rstprod" and its permission to "640" so that it could only be
      read by users in the rstprod group.  This is no longer needed since
      "gpsipw" has now been added to the list of dump files for which this needs
      to be done in obsproc_dump.v3.3.0 which is being implemented
      simultaneously with obsproc_rap.v2.3.0.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepdata.rap.parm:
    - The default overrides for AWINDO, JAMASS, JAWIND, IACFTL, AIFNOW and
      FLACMS are extended to accommodate three additional aircraft data types:
      Korean AMDAR (BUFR), AMDAR-catchall (BUFR) and Panasonic (AirDAT) TAMDAR
      (BUFR).  There were six, now there are nine.  Moisture will be processed
      (if available) for all three types, but otherwise they will get the same
      values as previously existing AMDAR types.  These three new aircraft data
      types, like all aircraft types, will be processed and included in the
      PREPBUFR files if found in the "aircft" dump files.
      BENEFIT: Korean AMDAR (BUFR) and AMDAR-catchall (BUFR) will be available
               for assimilation by the RAP GSI once found in "aircft" dump files
               (they are not yet there).  Panasonic (AirDAT) TAMDAR (BUFR) will
               be available for testing and eventual assimilation by the RAP GSI
               once found in "aircft" dump files (they are not yet there).


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump.v3.3.0:
       - Mesonet (msonet) dump files can now contain reports with purged/
         rejected QMs on p,t,q,uv.
    - After ARINC switches to v7 BUFR for AMDAR and MDCRS, dump files
      /com2/rap/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$RUN.t${cyc}z.aircar.tm00.bufr_d
      (where cyc= 00, 01, 02, ... , 21, 22, 23 for RUN=rap; cyc = 03, 04, 05,
      06, 07, 08, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 for RUN=rap_p; cyc = 00,12 for
      RUN=rap_e) can potentially store lat/lon (CLAT/CLON) to 10**5 precision.
   Job JRAP_DUMP_POST in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v2.3.0:
       - Listings for "aircft", "aircar", "adpupa", "adpsfc", "sfcshp",
         "msonet", "ascatw" and "gpsipw" dumps now print lat/lon out to 0.00001
         degree (although actual significance is still based on precision in the
         BUFR lat/lon encoded in each dump file).
   Job JRAP_PREP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.8.0:
       - E-AMDAR moisture now excoded into PREPBUFR files (not considered by
         assimilation).
       - PREPBUFR files now store lat/lon (YOB/XOB) to 10**5 precision, this
         will potentially be seen for the following types: AIRCFT 131/231
         E-AMDAR (only), AIRCFT 135/235 (Canadian-AMDAR), AIRCAR 133/233 (MDCRS)
         (after ARINC switches to v7 BUFR for AMDAR and MDCRS); as well as in
         GPSIPW 153 and MSONET 188/288 since these both have 10**5 precision in
         dumps.

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   All JOB scripts:
    - Execute "module list" to echo "Currently Loaded Modulefiles" to stdout.
    - Removed NCO vs developer checks on utility script setup.sh.
    - Generates fatal error message if any $HOMEobsproc_... component cannot be
      set due to missing version number setting.
    - Removed direct path to setpdy.sh utility script, relying on versions
      added to PATH (presumably by prod_util module).
    - Generalized settings for variables COMIN and COMOUT for both NCO and
      developer cases.  Consistent with other network job scripts.
   JRAP_DUMP:
    - Use NCO-established variable $NWROOTp1 to point to root directory for
      Phase 1 software components (defaults to /nwprod, transitional).
    - Points to latest version of obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist in Phase 2 vs.
      Phase 1 ($NWROOTp2 replaces $NWROOTp1; the transitional setting for
      $NWROOTp2 added).
    - Obtains version number for module grib_util via imported environment
      variable $grib_util_ver.  This is defined in the upstream ecflow script.
      Current setting is grib_util_ver=v1.0.1.
       - Load module grib_util/v1.0.1.
          - Removed setting of variable EXGRBIX.
      BENEFIT: Defines path now relied on to run utility program grbindex in
               ush script bufr_dump_obs.sh.
    - Remove exported script variable $utilparm (which defaulted to
      /nwprod/util/parm) as it is no longer required by any child scripts.
   JRAP_DUMP_POST:
    - Use NCO-established variable $NWROOTp1 to point to root directory for
      Phase 1 software components (defaults to /nwprod, transitional).
    - Points to latest version of obsproc_dump_post and
      obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist in Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 ($NWROOTp2 replaces
      $NWROOTp1; the transitional setting for $NWROOTp2 added).
    - Generalize setting of variable $HOMEarch.
      BENEFIT: Allows for future transition to Phase2 (/com2) root output
               directory.
    - Remove variable $COMROOTp1.  No longer needed.
    - More flexible options for specifiying variable $AVGDarch_OUT in developer
      runs.
   JRAP_PREP:
    - Obtains version number for module util_shared via imported environment
      variable $util_shared_ver.  This is defined in the upstream ecflow script.
      Current setting is util_shared_ver=v1.0.4.
       - Load module util_shared/v1.0.4.       
      BENEFIT: Defines prepended path now relied on to run utility ush
               getges.sh in ush script prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh.
      Note: Exported script variables GETGES_COM and GETGES_NWG are retained
            with no changes since they now always override getges.sh defaults
            of "$COMROOT" and "$GESROOT", resp. in module util_shared/v1.0.4
            version of utility ush getges.sh.  Since the default for GETGES_COM
            in these job scripts is "/com2", this avoids the need to set
            GETGES_COM to "/com2" in the driver scripts in the event this must
            be implemented prior to RAP upgrade to Phase 2 (see 2.1.0 below)
            meaning the driver (ecflow) script still exports COMROOT as "/com".
            This also gives flexibility for cases when a development or test
            run may redirect COMROOT or GESROOT to an alternate location. It
            also avoids the need to set GETGES_COM or GETGES_NWG in the driver
            script in this case.  Also allows GETGES_COM or GETGES_NWG to be
            set to an alternative location in driver script.
    - Replaces generic $NWROOT with more specific $NWROOTp2 as root to
      obsproc_prep in Phase 2 (the transitional setting for $NWROOTp2 added).
   JRAP_PREP_POST:
    - Use NCO-established variable $NWROOTp1 to point to root directory for
      Phase 1 software components (defaults to /nwprod, transitional).
    - Points to latest version of obsproc_prep_post in Phase 2 vs. Phase 1
      ($NWROOTp2 replaces $NWROOTp1; the transitional setting for $NWROOTp2
      added).
   JRAP_PREP, JRAP_PREP_POST:
    - Remove exported script variable $utilexec (which defaulted to
      /nwprod/util/exec) as it is no longer required by any child scripts.

 Model script changes:
   exrap_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Replaced "/com" with full file name path beginning with ${COMSP} in
      messages posted to jlogfile when copying IMS snow grib file.
      BENEFIT: Adds more information, generalizes for transition from Phase 1
               (/com) to Phase 2 (/com2).
    - Adjusted the window from "-1.0 to -0.50 hours" to "-1.05 to -0.95 hours"
      (-63 to -57 min) for full-cycle and early runs, to "-0.05 to +0.05 hours"
      (-3 to +3 min) for partial-cycle runs other than at 08 and 20z, and to
      "-0.55 to -0.45 hours" (-33 to -27 min) for partial-cycle runs at 08 or
      20z to accommodate the new Ground Based GPS-IPW/ZTD (from U.S.- ENI and
      foreign GNSS providers) in dump message type NC012004.
      BENEFIT: Keeps the number of U.S.-ENI reports dumped from being too much
               larger than that from the previous GSD-feed in dump message type
               NC012003 since the ENI reports are available every 5 min while
               the GSD reports were available only every 30 min. Accounts for an
               approximate 80-min latency in the U.S.-ENI reports. (The dump
               time windows may be tweaked in the future.)
    - Added temporary logic to change "gpsipw" dump file's group to "rstprod"
      and its permission to "640" so that it can only be read by users in the
      rstprod group.
      BENEFIT: New "gpsipw" dump file is restricted.  The logic to restrict dump
               files is done in obsproc_dump ush script bufr_dump_obs.sh, where
               the list of files to restrict is hardwired.  Since obsproc_dump
               is not included in this release bundle, the restriction must be
               done here.  This temporary logic will be removed once a future
               change to add "gpsipw" to the list of dump files to restrict is
               made in the next obsproc_dump release.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.3.0:
       - Dump files
         /com2/rap/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$RUN.t${cyc}z.gpsipw.tm00.bufr_d
         now contain new U.S.-ENI and foreign-GNSS Ground Based GPS-IPW/ZTD
         (message type NC012004) (before they contained U.S.-GSD Ground Based
         GPS-IPW/ZTD, message type NC012003).  They will also now be restricted.
          - As a result of above, the dump "status" files
            /com2/rap/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$RUN.t${cyc}z.status.tm00.bufr_d
            will now likely reflect a different dump count for data group
            "gpsipw" (now in 012.004 as opposed to 012.003 before).  This change
            in dump counts will be reflected in the RTDM "RAP Data Dump Tables"
            under the new data type "gnss" (which replaces "gpspw" which
            represented the old-GSD feed).
    - The time window for new U.S.-ENI and foreign-GNSS Ground Based
      GPS-IPW/ZTD in dump files
      /com2/rap/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$RUN.t${cyc}z.gpsipw.tm00.bufr_d
      is +/- 3-min about cycle time (the time window for previous U.S.-GSD
      Ground Based GPS-IPW/ZTD was -1.0 to -0.50 hours about cycle time).
   Job JRAP_DUMP_POST in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v2.2.0:
       - The following new files are created:
         /com2/rap/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$RUN.t${cyc}z.gpsipw.tm00.bufr_d.nr
       - Dump listing files
         /com2/rap/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$RUN.t${cyc}z.gpsipw.tm00.bufr_d.listing
         list lat and lon to nearest 0.00001 degree rather than to nearest 0.01
         degree.  These files are now restricted.
   Job JRAP_PREP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.7.0:
       - Reports in PREPBUFR files with message type GPSIPW (report type 153)
         will now contain new U.S.-ENI Ground Based GPS-IPW/ZTD at cycle time
         (before they contained U.S.-GSD Ground Based GPS-IPW at 45-min prior to
         cycle time).
          - Encodes zenith total delay (when present) and its error into
            PREPBUFR file, represented by "atmospheric path delay in satellite
            signal" (mnemonic APDS) and "error in atmospheric path delay in
            satellite signal" (mnemonic APDE), resp., in association with
            hardwired azimuth angle (mnemonic BEARAZ) of 0.0 (deg) and hardwired
            elevation angle (mnemonic ELEV) of 90.0 (deg).
   Job JRAP_PREP_POST in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep_post.v2.3.0:
       - Non-restricted PREPBUFR files Files
         /com2/rap/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$RUN.t${cyc}z.prepbufr.${tmmark}.nr
         /com2/rap/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$RUN.t${cyc}z.prepbufr_pre-qc.${tmmark}.nr
         no longer contain any reports in message type "GPSIPW" (as all reports
         are restricted and stripped out)

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   All JOB scripts:
    - Use NCO-established variables to point to root directories for main 
      software components and input/output directories in order to run on
      WCOSS Phase 1 or Phase 2.  (Some util* variables remain and point to 
      /nwprod/util as required by called obsproc application scripts).
    - Use new NCO standard variable KEEPDATA in place of CLEANUP to decide
      whether to remove working directory at end of run.
    - Removed NCO vs developer checks in places were we could rely on variables
      set in ecflow environment for NCO runs. Modified remaining such wrappers
      to check setting of NCO standard variable RUN_ENVIR in place of
      non-standard variables used previously.
    - Revised logic that generates version informational output at the start of
      the job for cleaner script and output.
   JRAP_DUMP_POST:
    - Added entries for variable comin and comin_m1 to override default
      settings in shared application script bufr_avgdata.sh.

 Model script changes:
   exrap_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Modified to add the dumping of SEVIRI CSR ("sevcsr"), GPS Radio
      Occultation ("gpsro"), SSM/IS UPP radiance ("ssmisu") and SBUV ozone
      ("osbuv8") data, all in a time window from -2.00 to +0.43 hours relative
      to cycle time for the full-cycle RAP at 01-11 and 13-23z cycles and the
      early RAP (RAP_E) at 00 and 12z cycles, in a time window from -2.00 to
      +0.97 hours relative to cycle time for the full-cycle RAP at 00 and
      12z cycles, and in a time window from -1.00 to +0.99 hours relative to
      cycle time for the partial-cycle RAP (RAP_P).
      BENEFIT: These have been requested by NOAA/ESRL/GSD for tests in their
               RAP model runs.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepdata.rap.parm:
    - New VAD winds from level 2 decoder (BUFR type 002, subtype 017) are no
      longer excluded from encoding into RAP PREPBUFR files (all cycle runs)
      [switch SUBSKP(002,017) = TRUE is removed and reverts back to default of
      FALSE].
      BENEFIT: The updated RAP GSI will now assimilate these reports.

 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - Creates new dump files
      /com2/rap/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$RUN.t${cyc}z.<file>.tm00.bufr_d,
      where cyc= 00, 01, 02, ... , 21, 22, 23 for RUN=rap; cyc = 03, 04, 05,
      06, 07, 08, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 for RUN=rap_p; cyc = 00,12 for
      RUN=rap_e; and file = sevcsr, gpsro, ssmisu, osbuv8.
   Job JRAP_PREP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - VAD wind data from level 2 decoder will now be encoded in PREPBUFR file,
      under report type 224, subtype 2.
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.6.0:
       - Surface land METAR reports in PREPBUFR files with message type ADPSFC
         (report type 187) will now contain a cloud ceiling field (derived from
         cloud amount and cloud height values) represented by mnemonic CEILING.
         This is not read by the RAP-GSI.

 only change:

 M obsproc_rap/jobs/JRAP_PREP
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   JRAP_PREP:
    - Added GETGES_COM with default of /com2 to override getges.sh default.
      BENEFIT: Overrides default value "/com" still in util ush getges.sh.
               Needed once GFS moves to Phase 2 (presumably at the same time
               this release is implemented).  Ecflow scripts for JRAP_PREP can
               override this if necessary.
    - Added GETGES_NWG with default of /nwges2 to override getges.sh default.
      BENEFIT: Overrides default value "/nwges" still in util ush getges.sh.
               Needed once GFS moves to Phase 2 (presumably at the same time
               this release is implemented).  Ecflow scripts for JRAP_PREP can
               override this if necessary.

This release was generated by NCO/PMB.

This is part of OBSPROC.v6.1.0.

obsproc_rap release 2.0.3 --> released May 1, 2015
                          --> implemented Aug 10, 2015

files added, modified or deleted with this release:
 M obsproc_rap/jobs/JRAP_DUMP
 M obsproc_rap/parm/prepobs_prepdata.rap.parm
 M obsproc_rap/scripts/exrap_dump.sh.ecf

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   JRAP_DUMP:
    - Handles early HRRR cycle 00-23z runs (RUN=rap_eh) [in addition to full-
      cycle (RUN=rap), partial-cycle (RUN=rap_p) and early (RUN=rap_e) runs].
      Early HRRR set up to dump only "nexrad" data.
      BENEFIT: Early (T+0:16) HRRR (RAP) "nexrad" dump files will now be
               created at 00-23z and posted to /com for use be the future HRRR
               implementation (at the request of GSD).

 Model script changes:
   exrap_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Dump window for new satwnd type NC005019 (GOES IR/SW) set to -1.00 to
      -0.01 hours about center dump time.
      BENEFIT: Will match dump window for other GOES types, providing a single
               hourly set for each GOES satellite, closest to center dump time.
    - Added dump thread #5 (aircft, aircar, goesnd) to cfp command list rather
      than running it outside of poe. Reordered cfp commands to execute the
      longer running commands first. Minor dump group shuffling. Added a new
      dump thread comprised of six dump groups (1bhrs4, airsev, lghtng, eshrs3,
      lgycld. cris) originally in two other threads that had a long run time.
      BENEFIT: Speeds up run time which is needed now that subsequent PREP job
               is slower due to interpolation of recently implemented T1534
               global guess.
    -  In "rap_eh" run (only), add test for number of dump groups expected and
       exported in upstream job script ($num_DUMP_group). If this doesn't agree
       with what is expected here, abort.         
       BENEFIT: Ensures job & model scripts are in sync with respect to this
                number since the job script needs to know which dump group(s)
                to process in the "rap_eh" run.
    - NeXRaD VAD winds from level 2 decoder (type 002, subtype 017) added to
      "vadwnd" dump files [joins existing BUFR type 002, subtype 008 (NEXRAD
      VAD winds coming from radar coded message)].
      BENEFIT: These are being tested in the parallel RAP in preparation for
               their operational use in the next RAP upgrade.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepdata.rap.parm:
    - New VAD winds from level 2 decoder (BUFR type 002, subtype 017) are
      excluded from encoding into RAP PREPBUFR files (all cycle runs) [switch
      SUBSKP(002,017) set to TRUE].
      BENEFIT: The current operational RAP GSI cannot properly handle these
               reports.  They will be used in the next update to the RAP GSI.
    - The moisture on a level for any report type with dewpoint temperature >
      305K will be flagged as bad (switch TDMAX set to 305.).
      BENEFIT: Per GSD, some sfc moisture observations with very high dewpoint
               temperature getting into RAP/HRRR analysis have caused spurious
               storms in the RAP/HRRR forecast. This will no longer occur.
    - Minor comment changes.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - "vadwnd" dump files in /com/rap/prod/... directories  will now contain
      NeXRaD VAD winds from level 2 decoder (type 002, subtype 017) [as well as
      NeXRaD VAD winds from radar coded message (type 002, subtype 008) from
      before]. These are being tested in the parallel RAP in preparation for
      their operational use in the next RAP upgrade. Note: the current
      production system is not affected by this change as these are skipped
      over when PREPDATA reads the "vadwnd" dump file.
    - As a result of update to obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.2.0:
       - "3P9US" (GOES IR/SW), "INFAV" (AVHRR IR/LW) and "INFVR" (VIIRS IR/LW)
         will now appear in full-cycle RAP RTDM count graphics.
       - The "satwnd" dump files will contain GOES IR/SW, POES AVHRR/IR/LW and
         POES VIIRS/IR/LW winds.
   Job JRAP_DUMP in early HRRR runs:
    - Creates dump files
      /com/rap/prod/rap_eh.$PDY/rap_eh.t${cyc}z.nexrad.tm00.bufr_d ,
      where cyc = 00-23.
   Job JRAP_DUMP_POST in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - New VAD wind reports from level 2 decoder added to "vadwnd" dump listing
      files in /com/rap/prod/... directories
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v2.0.1:
       - Total cloud cover (TOCC) is now correctly listed in
         [rap][rap_e][rap_p].t${cyc}.goesnd.${tmmark}.bufr_d.listing files in
         /com/rap/prod/[rap][rap_e][rap_p].${PDY} directories (prior to this it
         was missing).
   Job JRAP_PREP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.5.0:
       - Valid TSB values will be encoded into PREPBUFR file for reports in
         message type AIRCAR.
       - Marine reports previously, incorrectly deemed over land and flagged
         will now be deemed over water and be available for assimilation.
       - Total cloud cover (TOCC) is now encoded in PREPBUFR files for reports
         in message type GOESND with type 151.
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.5.0 plus prepdata parm change
      above:
       - QQM (moisture quality mark) will now be set to 15 on any level, for
         any report, where the reported dewpoint temperature is > 305K.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - previous job card specs were:
         poe, prod_shared queue, 2 tasks, ptile=2, 4500 Mb per task
    - recommended job card specs are:
         poe, prod_shared queue, 3 tasks, ptile=3, 3000 Mb per task
    - The combination of the above job card changes as well as the changes in
      model script exrap_dump.sh.ecf (see above) result in ~50 sec decrease in
      run time for a full-cycle job and ~70 sec decrease in run time for a
      partial-cycle job. This helps to offset the wallclock run time increase
      in the subsequent PREP jobs due to interpolation of recently implemented
      T1534 global guess.
    - No change to memory usage.
   Job JRAP_DUMP in early HRRR runs:
    - this is NEW
    - runs in poe, prod_shared queue, 3 tasks, ptile=3, 3000 Mb per task
    - affinity[core]
    - wallclock run time limit is 30 minutes
    - wallclock run time is ~ 45-70 seconds depending upon amount of data
      processed and machine contention
    - runs 24 times daily for 00-23z cycles, triggered by the clock at 16
      minutes past the cycle hour
    - this dump job does not trigger any other jobs upon its completion
    - data retention in /com should be same as for full-cycle RAP DUMP files
      (3 days)
   Job JRAP_PREP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - program prepobs_prepacqc now uses more memory due to an increase in
      array parameter "max_reps":
            previous: The maximum resident set size (KB) = 1024368
            now:      The maximum resident set size (KB) = 1366072
    - No other changes to memory usage.
   All other jobs:
    - No change in requested resources in the job cards.
    - No change to memory usage.
    - No change in wallclock run time.


 Disk Space Changes:
 -------------------
   /com/rap/prod/rap.    - Increase ~84 Mb per day
   /com/rap/prod/rap_e.  - Increase ~ 7 Mb per day
   /com/rap/prod/rap_p.  - Increase ~40 Mb per day
   /com/rap/prod/rap_eh. - New, ~19.1 Gb per day (quite variable, this is max.
                                                  over past 5 days)

 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   - Test all four production jobs for full-cycle, partial-cycle, early RAP and
     early HRRR.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   - The main users of this output are the RAP full-cycle, partial-cycle and
     early networks, and the HRRR network.
   Job JRAP_DUMP in early HRRR:
    - Dump files should be posted in /com on prod & dev WCOSS and on same R & D
      machines as full-cycle RAP and partial-cycle RAP, and on ftpprd server
      (non-restricted files only for latter).
    - Archive same files as for full-cycle RAP and partial-cycle RAP on HPSS.
   All other jobs:
    - No change in dissemination.
    - No change in archival on HPSS outside of changes to /com noted previously.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v5.0.0.
   - The ecflow task script to submit the early HRRR JRAP_DUMP run should be
     submitted at 16 minutes past the hour for the 00-23z cycles. It should be
     designed the same as all other JRAP_DUMP ecflow task scripts except it
     should export job=rap_dump_ehrrr_<CC> (where CC is cycle).

   This must be implemented either simultaneously with or after the
   implementation of:

obsproc_rap release 2.0.2 --> released Sep 14, 2014
                          --> implemented Nov 4, 2014

files added, modified or deleted with this release:
 M obsproc_rap/jobs/JRAP_DUMP

 M obsproc_rap/jobs/JRAP_PREP
 M obsproc_rap/jobs/JRAP_PREP_POST
 M obsproc_rap/scripts/exrap_dump.sh.ecf

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   JRAP_DUMP_POST, JRAP_PREP, JRAP_PREP_POST:
    - Remove unnecessary setting of environment variable TMPDIR (not
      referenced in child scripts).
   JRAP_DUMP:
    - Updated comment explaining reason for hardwire of environment variable
      TMPDIR.
   JRAP_PREP:
    - Modify the setting of NSPLIT variable used to break up data for parallel
      processing.  The (default) setting is now 3.
      BENEFIT: This is in preparation for the expected larger size of global
               background fields (T1534) in the upcoming 2014 GFS upgrade and
               is needed due to current memory limitations.
    - Add comments and settings in preparation for potential upgrade to use
      poe rather than background threads for parallel processing in
      prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh (under development in obsproc_prep application
      package).
   JRAP_PREP_POST:
    - All references to PROCESS_SATELLITE_COUNTS removed since
      /nwprod/ush/global_satcount.sh is obsolete.

 Model script changes:
   exrap_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Add parallel scripting option to replace background threads for
      simultaneous dump group processing.
      BENEFIT: Improves timing [compensates for increased run time in PREP
               jobs due to change to NSPLIT=3 in JRAP_PREP (see change above)].
               Complies with NCO's request to remove background processes from
               production scripts.
    - Minor dump group shuffling.
      BENEFIT: Allows DUMP + PREP combined run time to be close to the same as
               before.
    - Removed the dumping of AMSU-B data ("1bamub", "esamub") and HIRS-3 data
      ("1bhrs3").
      BENEFIT: These data are no longer processed.  The only dumps being
               produced are "esamub", but these contain all missing btemps.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - Empty dump files "1bamub" and "1bhrs3" will no longer be present in
      /com/rap/prod/... directories.
    - The small dump file "esamub" (containing no usable data) will no longer
      be present in /com/rap/prod/... directories.
   Job JRAP_DUMP in full-cycle runs:
    - "1BAMUB", "1BHRS3" and "ESAMUB" will no longer appear in RAP RTDM count
       graphics.
   Job JRAP_DUMP_POST in full-cycle runs (23z cycle run only):
    - As a result of update to obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.v1.0.1:
       - The obcount_30day rap directory (/com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/rap)
         will now retain 32 days worth of files instead of 30 days. Despite
         retaining 32 days of files, averages will continue to be contructed
         from only the past 30 days.
   Job JRAP_PREP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.2.0:
       - DFQ now encoded in PREPBUFR file in some cases for surface data.
       - WQM will not be encoded in PREPBUFR file if UOB and VOB are missing
         for surface data.
       - DFP now encoded in PREPBUFR file in some cases for surface data.
       - DFR now encoded in PREPBUFR file in some cases for surface data.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - previous job card specs were:
         full-cycle and partial-cycle: serial, shared, 6000 Mb
         early: serial, shared, 5000 Mb
    - recommended job card specs are:
         full-cycle, partial-cycle and early: parallel, shared, 2 tasks,
                                              ptile=2, 4500 Mb per task
    - the above job card changes will result in ~15 sec decrease in wallclock
      run time, offsetting the wallclock run time increase in the PREP jobs
      (see above) (also maybe a 2 sec decrease in run time with removal of
      three obsolete dump types)
    - Note: The expected larger size of global background fields associated
            with the 2014 GFS upgrade (T1534) will likely require tweaking of
            the DUMP job card specs to further speed up the DUMP jobs in order
            to compensate for the expected slower run time in the PREP jobs
            (see above).  This will have to be worked out during NCO's testing
            of the PREP jobs using the T1534 background.
   Job JRAP_PREP in full-cycle, partial-cycle and early runs:
    - ~15 second increase in wallclock run time
    - previous job card specs were:
         parallel, exclusive, 12 tasks, ptile=12
    - recommended job card specs are:
         parallel, exclusive, 3 tasks, ptile=3
    - Note 1: Since PREPBUFR processing does not yet run under poe (it still
              runs background processes), the number of tasks and ptile here
              are not actually used.  However, we will eventually switch to poe
              so it makes sense now to change these.
    - Note 2: The expected larger size of global background fields associated
              with the 2014 GFS upgrade (T1534) may require tweaking of the job
              card specs to compensate for the expected much slower run time in
              these jobs.  Much of this added run time will likely have to be
              made up for in the DUMP jobs (see below).  This will have to be
              worked out during NCO's testing of these jobs using the T1534
              background.
   No other changes in requested resources in the job cards.
   No changes to memory usage.
   No other changes in disk space and run time.

 JOB script changes:
   All JOB scripts:
    - Require that the developer export their own particular temporary
      directory root ($DATAROOT) into the job scripts. If $DATAROOT is not set
      in these scripts, the script will abort.
      NOTE: This does not affect production.
      BENEFIT: This avoids having to hardwire a development-specific default
               temporary directory root in these job scripts. This can now be
               different for different development groups.
   JRAP_DUMP_POST:
    - Initial population into vertical structure.
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Obtains obsproc_rap, obsproc_dump_post, obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest,
      obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata and obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist version
      numbers via imported environment variables $obsproc_rap_ver (changed from
      $model_ver), $obsproc_dump_post_ver, $obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest_ver,
      $obsproc_shared_bufr_avgdata_ver and $obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver,
      resp.  These are defined in the upstream ecflow script.
    - Full environmental equivalence.  Streamlined, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for developer runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_dump_post which points to
      directory path for generic dump_post subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_dump_post.$obsproc_dump_post_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir}
      in order to point to files in scripts and exec directories moved from
      horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_network (changed from
      $HOMErap) which points to directory path for network-specific
      subdirectories under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_rap.$obsproc_rap_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir}.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_remorest which
      points to directory path for generic shared bufr_remorest subdirectories
      under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest.${obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_avgdata which
      points to directory path for generic shared bufr_avgdata subdirectories
      under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.${obsproc_shared_bufr_avgdata_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist which
      points to directory path for generic shared bufr_dumplist subdirectories
      under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.${obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in fix directory moved
      from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Handles early RAP 00/12z runs (RUN=rap_e) [in addition to full-cycle
      (RUN=rap) and partial-cycle (RUN=rap_p) runs].
      BENEFIT: Early RAP non-restricted dump files and listings of dump files
               will now be created in production for GSD and available in /com
               (prior to this they were not being generated in developer cron
               jobs).
   JRAP_PREP:
    - Initial population into vertical structure (in obsproc).
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Obtains obsproc_rap and obsproc_prep version numbers via imported
      environment variables $obsproc_rap_ver (changed from $model_ver) and
      $obsproc_prep_ver, resp.  These are defined in the upstream ecflow
      script.
    - Full environmental equivalence. Streamlined, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for developer runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_prep which points to
      directory path for generic prep subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally /nwprod/obsproc_prep.$obsproc_prep_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec, fix and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_network (changed from
      $HOMErap) which points to directory path for network-specific prep
      subdirectories under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_rap.$obsproc_rap_ver).  Replaces
      /nw${envir}/rap.${model_ver} in order to point to files in scripts and
      parm directory moved from model-related vertical directory structure to
      new obsproc-related vertical directory structure.
    - Export environment variable $errPREPDATA_limit as "4" at all center hour
      (cycle) times. Before, it was set to default of "0" at 00 and 12z center
      hour times and "4" at all other center hour times in model script
      exrap_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf.
      BENEFIT: PREPOBS_PREPDATA will no longer abort in 00 or 12z center hour
               (cycle) time runs when it finds no data in either the input
               "adpupa" or "adpsfc" dump files. A diagnostic will be printed in
               stdout.  The modern GSI can run ok if these data are not
               available for some unexpected reason.
    - Handles early RAP 00/12z runs (RUN=rap_e) [in addition to full-cycle
      (RUN=rap) and partial-cycle (RUN=rap_p) runs].
      BENEFIT: Early RAP PREPBUFR files will now be created in production for
               GSD and available in /com (prior to this they were generated
               only in developer cron jobs).
   JRAP_PREP_POST:
    - Initial population into vertical structure (in obsproc).
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Obtains obsproc_rap, obsproc_prep_post and obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest
      version numbers via imported environment variables $obsproc_rap_ver
      (changed from $model_ver), $obsproc_prep_post_ver and
      $obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest_ver, resp.  These are defined in the
      upstream ecflow script.
    - Full environmental equivalence.  Streamlined, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for developer runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_prep_post which points to
      directory path for generic prep_post subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_prep_post.$obsproc_prep_post_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir}
      in order to point to files in scripts directory moved from horizontal to
      vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_network (changed from
      $HOMErap) which points to directory path for network-specific
      subdirectories under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_rap.$obsproc_rap_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir}.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_remorest which
      points to directory path for generic shared bufr_remorest subdirectories
      under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest.${obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Handles early RAP 00/12z runs (RUN=rap_e) [in addition to full-cycle
      (RUN=rap) and partial-cycle (RUN=rap_p) runs].
      BENEFIT: Early RAP non-restricted PREPBUFR files will now be created in
               production for GSD and available in /com (prior to this they
               were not being generated in developer cron jobs).

 Model script changes:
   exrap_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf:
    - Initial population into vertical structure (in obsproc).
    - Modified to change path to prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh from $ushscript to
      $ushscript_prep as obsproc_prep package has been populated into vertical
      structure.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepdata.rap.parm:
    - Initial population into vertical structure (in obsproc).
    - Removed comments related to version number, implementation date, and/or
      history.  No longer needed now that this file is in subversion.
    - New 12'th surface type (representing Coast Guard data) added to arrays
      JSURFW (=0) and FWINDO (=150.).
      BENEFIT: Coast guard mass and wind data now processed and available for
               analysis.
    - New switch NPKRPT (12*TRUE) to control processing of surface obs with
      missing pressure information.  TRUE here means all of the following:
         - Will process surface reports that would otherwise be tossed due to
           their having a missing pstn.
         - These reports estimate pstn from the reported or U.S. Standard
           Atmosphere pmsl, the reported or U.S. Standard Atmosphere sensible
           temperature, and the reported elevation (only marine reports > 7.5 m
           can have a reported pmsl and fall into this category). This
           estimated pstn (POB) is used to estimate q (QOB).  Both POB and QOB
           are assigned minimum q.m.'s (PQM, QQM) of 3. This estimated POB is
           encoded into PREPBUFR file.
         - These reports are then assigned new PREPBUFR report types 192/292
           (SYNOP), 193/293 (METAR), 194/294 (marine) and 195/295 (mesonet).
         - ATLAS buoy wind reports which also have missing pstn and pmsl will
           continue to be processed as before (PREPBUFR report type 282
           (Note: This means that if an ATLAS buoy ever had T,q info, its mass
                  piece would still be tossed rather than getting into PREPBUFR
                  file under under report type 194 (may need to fix this logic
                  someday).
         - MESONETS will no longer have "x" in character 8 of id, instead they
           will get PREPBUFR report types 195/295 rather than 188/288.
      BENEFIT: ADPSFC, SFCSHP, and MSONET reports that do not contain station
               pressure information are now retained (previously, they were
               discarded) and are available for the analysis.
   prepobs_prepssmi.rap.parm:
    - Removed comments related to version number, implementation date, and/or
      history.  No longer needed now that this file is in subversion.
      Otherwise, no changes to contents.
   prepobs_cqcbufr.rap.parm, prepobs_prepacqc.rap.parm,
   prepobs_profcqc.rap.parm:
    - Initial population into vertical structure (in obsproc).
    - Removed comments related to version number, implementation date, and/or
      history.  No longer needed now that these files are in subversion.
      Otherwise, no changes to contents.

obsproc_rap release 1.1.0 --> released Feb 9, 2014
                          --> implemented May 6, 2014

files added, modified or deleted with this release:
 M obsproc_rap/scripts/exrap_dump.sh.ecf

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 Model script changes:
   exrap_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Modified to dump GOES IR, water vapor, and visible satellite-derived
      winds using a time window of -1.00 to -0.01 hours relative to cycle time
      for the RAP, RAP_P and RAP_E, rather than -2.50 to +0.43 hours relative
      to cycle time for the full-cycle RAP at 01-11 and 13-23z cycles, -1.50
      to +0.97 hours relative to cycle time for the full-cycle RAP at 00 and
      12z cycles, and -1.50 to +1.50 hours relative to cycle time for the
      partial-cycle RAP (RAP_P).  [Note: The early RAP (RAP_E) at 00 and 12z
      cycles is being dumped for the first time here.]
      BENEFIT: NESDIS is changing the frequency of their GOES satellite
               derived winds from 3-hourly to 1-hourly. The change to
               exrap_dump.sh.ecf will allow one complete wind set to be dumped
               and assimilated at every cycle time (not changing the time
               window could at least triple the number of winds assimilated at
               some cycles, all over the same locations). This change will also
               allow winds closer to cycle time to now be assimilated.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   No changes.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP in full-cycle RAP, partial-cycle RAP and early RAP:
    - continues to use code from obsproc_dump.v3.0.0
    - continues to use code from obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.0.0
    - no other changes


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   - Test production job JRAP_DUMP for full-cycle, partial-cycle and early RAP.
   - This is part of the parallel-production test of the hourly GOES satellite
     winds.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   - The main users of this output are the RAP full-cycle, partial-cycle and
     early networks.
   - No change in dissemination.
   - No change in archival on HPSS.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v2.0.0.
   This must be implemented at EXACTLY the same time as NESDIS' promotion of
   the hourly GOES satellite winds to their production server, and
   simultaneously with the implementations of obsproc_dump_monitor.v1.1.0,
   obsproc_global.v1.1.0, obsproc_nam.v1.1.0, obsproc_rtma.v1.2.0,

obsproc_rap release 1.0.0 --> released Feb 8, 2014
                          --> implemented Apr 8, 2014

Initial population of vertical structure (in obsproc).

files added, modified or deleted with this release:
 M obsproc_rap/jobs/JRAP_DUMP
 M obsproc_rap/parm/prepobs_prepssmi.rap.parm
 M obsproc_rap/scripts/exrap_dump.sh.ecf

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   JRAP_DUMP:
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Obtains obsproc_rap, obsproc_dump and obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist
      version numbers via imported environment variables $obsproc_rap_ver,
      $obsproc_dump_ver and obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver, resp.  These are
      defined in the upstream ecflow script.
    - Full environmental equivalence.  Additional streamlining, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for developer runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_dump which points to
      directory path for generic dump subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally /nwprod/obsproc_dump.$obsproc_dump_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec, fix and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_network (changed from
      $HOMErap) which points to directory path for network-specific dump
      subdirectories under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_rap.$obsproc_rap_ver).  Replaces
      /nw${envir}/rap.${model_ver} in order to point to files in scripts and
      parm directory moved from model-related vertical directory structure to
      new obsproc-related vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variables $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist and
      $FIXobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist which point to directory path for
      bufr_dumplist fixed file under version control (in production the latter
      is normally
   /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.$obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver/fix).
      Replaces /nw${envir}/fix from old horizontal directory structure.
    - Handles early RAP 00/12z runs (RUN=rap_e) [in addition to full-cycle
      (RUN=rap) and partial-cycle (RUN=rap_p) runs].

 Model script changes:
   exrap_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Modified to skip the dumping of NeXRaD VAD winds from level 2 decoder
      (type 002, subtype 017) as part of the "vadwnd" dump ["vadwnd" will still
      contain only NeXRaD VAD winds from radar coded message (type 002, subtype
      008) for now].
      BENEFIT: The default is to now include NeXRaD VAD winds from the level 2
               decoder in the "vadwnd" dump file (as they will be used in the
               FY14Q2 NAM bundle).  The RAP GSI cannot handle these at this
               time.
    - Modified to add the dumping of CrIS ("cris") , ATMS ("atms") and IASI
      ("mtiasi") data, all in a time window from -2.00 to +0.43 hours relative
      to cycle time for the full-cycle RAP at 01-11 and 13-23z cycles and the
      early RAP (RAP_E) at 00 and 12z cycles, in a time window from -2.00 to
      +0.97 hours relative to cycle time for the full-cycle RAP at 00 and
      12z cycles, and in a time window from -1.00 to +0.99 hours relative to
      cycle time for the partial-cycle RAP (RAP_P).
      BENEFIT: These have been requested by NOAA/ESRL/GSD for tests in their
               RAP model runs.
    - Modified to turn off the attempt to dump "wndsat" data.
      BENEFIT: The WindSat scatterometer data ingest feed is currently broken
               as these data are now being produced under a new format that
               NCEP does not recognize.  As we transition to the new feed,
               we do not want to inadvertently dump these data in operations.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepssmi.rap.parm:
    - No changes to contents.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP in full-cycle RAP and partial-cycle RAP:
    - Creates new dump files
      /com/rap/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$RUN.t${cyc}z.<file>.tm00.bufr_d ,
      where cyc= 00, 01, 02, ... , 21, 22, 23 for RUN=rap; cyc = 03, 04, 05,
      06, 07, 08, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 for RUN=rap_p ; and file = atms,
      cris, mtiasi.
    - "ascatw" dump files will now contain scatterometer winds from METOP-B
      (as well as from METOP-A from before).
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump.v3.0.0:
       - If there are zero aircraft reports, processing will not seg fault in
         BUFR_DUPAIR.
   Job JRAP_DUMP in early RAP:
    - Creates entire set of new dump files
      /com/rap/prod/rap_e.$PDY/rap_e.t${cyc}z.<file>.tm00.bufr_d ,
      where cyc = 00 or 12; and file = 1bamua, 1bamub, 1bhrs3, 1bhrs4, 1bmhs,
      adpsfc, adpupa, aircar, aircft, airsev, ascatt, ascatw, atms, cris,
      esamua, esamub, eshrs3, esmhs, goesnd, gpsipw, lghtng, lgycld, msonet,
      mtiasi, nexrad, proflr, radwnd, rassda, satwnd, sfcshp, vadwnd, wdsatr,
      wndsat.
    - Copies the imssnow grib file
      /com/rap/prod/rap_e.$PDY/rap_e.t${cyc}z.imssnow , where cyc = 00 or 12.
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump.v3.0.0:
       - If there are zero aircraft reports, processing will not seg fault in
         BUFR_DUPAIR.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Job JRAP_DUMP in full-cycle RAP and partial-cycle RAP:
    - 10 second increase in wallclock run time
    - disk space required per day for all new output dump files is:
        rap: atms:     ~ 125 MBytes

        rap_p: mtiasi: ~ 706 MBytes
        TOTAL:       ~ 3.084 GBytes
    - the "ascatw" dump files will now be approximately twice as large since
      they will now include METOP-B (as well as METOP-A from before)
        rap & rap_p combined:
           ascatw increases from ~ 4.5 MBytes/day to ~ 9 MBytes/day
    - uses code from obsproc_dump.v3.0.0
    - uses code from obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.0.0
    - no other changes
   Job JRAP_DUMP in early RAP:
    - runs in prod_serv, serial, 1 core
    - rusage[mem=5000], affinity[core]
    - wallclock run time limit is 30 minutes
    - wallclock run time is ~ 60-135 seconds depending upon amount of data
      processed and machine contention
    - disk space required per day for full suite of output dump files is
      ~ 1.75 GBytes
    - disk space required per day for imssnow grib files is 39.92 MBytes
    - runs twice daily at 00 and 12z, at 26 minutes past the hour, triggered
      by clock
        - data cutoff time is 26 minutes (e.g., 00z cycle runs at 0026 UTC)
        - there is only a dump job - this job does not trigger any other jobs
          upon its completion
    - data retention in /com should be same as for full-cycle rap dump files
      (3 days)
    - uses code from obsproc_dump.v3.0.0
    - uses code from obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.0.0
    - no other changes


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
