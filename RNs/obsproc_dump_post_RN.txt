 Model script changes:
   exdump_post.sh.ecf:
    - Modified to include "NC001101" in dump file "sfcshp" to the list
      of Table A entries for BUFR messages which contain all restricted
      reports in BUFR_REMOREST processing, but whose reports are
      retained and instead station IDs are masked.
      BENEFIT: properly adheres to restricted data use policy
 

 Source code changes:
   bufr_listdumps.fd/iw3unpbf.f:
    - In function R04UBF:
      - Fixed ambiguity in trap for buoy SST values (msg types 102, 103).
      - Added code to encode the cloud data for BUFR-feed ships data.
    - In function R02UBF:
      - Assigned input report type values of 524 and 525 to BUFR-feed
        ships data, for named and unnamed obs respectively (TAC-feeds
        remain as 522 and 523).
      - Assigned input report type value of 530 to BUFR-feed C-MAN platform
        reports (TAC-feed remains as 531).
   bufr_listdumps.fd/listdumps.f:
    - updated subroutine LISTSFC to include BUFR format ships and cman data.

    - Updated to run on Dell-p3 (as well as Cray-XC40 and IBM iDataPlex). 

 USH script changes:
   bufr_datacount.sh:
    - Removed all usages of "gdas1".

 Source code and build changes (in sorc directory):
   build.sh:
    - Updated to build codes on Dell-p3 or Cray-XC40 or IBM iDataPlex.
   load_libs.rc:
    - Updated to load modules for Dell-p3.
   bufr_listdumps.fd:
    iw3unpbf.f:
     - Added changes in function R06UBF to handle new GOES-16 & up satellite
       winds which do not contain a report id (STNID) and have high-res
       lat/lon (amongst other differences vs. GOES-15 & down). Report id
       for GOES-16 & up is hardwired to "--------".
    listdumps.f:
     - Added changes in subroutine LISTUPA. For SATWND types, prints
      lat and lon to nearest 0.00001 degree for GOES-16 and up reports
      since these have high-res lat/lon in their tanks.  All other
      SATWND types continue to print lat and lon to nearest 0.01 degree
      since they still have low-res lat/lon in their tanks (however the
      format statement is modified to add three blanks after the lat and
      lon to keep the alignment correct between GOES-16 and up reports
      and all other wind reports).

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 Model script changes:
   exdump_post.sh.ecf:
    - For "rtma_ru" runs, indicated by the existence of imported variable
      "cycM", adjusts joblog messages and stdout echo messages to include
      minutes, or fraction of hour where applicable, in cycle time and change
      run from RTMA to RTMA_RU.

 Source code changes:
   bufr_listdumps:
      listdumps.f (main program):
       - Added minutes to every print statement that includes the central dump
         time.  Central dump time minutes is obtained from Section 1 of first
         (dummy) message of input dump file via call to BUFRLIB routine IUPVS01.
         BENEFIT: Until now, central dump time minutes was always zero. However,
                  with the implementation of the new RTMA_RU, central dump time
                  can now also have minutes = 15, 30 or 45 (since the RTMA_RU
                  runs 4 times per hour). This change allows the print
                  statements to reflect this new center dump time format.
      iw3unpbf.f:
       - Added call to UFBINT to retrieve HOVI data.
         BENEFIT: Mesonet reports may now contain non-missing horizontal
                  visibility data encoded into the prepbufr file.

 Source code changes:
   bufr_listdumps:
      iw3unpbf.f (subroutine) (changes are in function R04UBF):
       - Mesonet reports now look for SDMEDIT quality marks in dump and store
         that information.  If missing then, as before, interpret MADIS quality
         mark and use that.
         BENFEFIT: Corrects a bug in code. SDMEDIT quality marks on mesonet
                   reports will now be honored (and will not be overwritten by
                   interpreted MADIS quality marks).

obsproc_dump_post release 3.0.0 --> released Apr 07, 2017
                                --> mplemented Jul 19, 2017

files added, modified or deleted since last release:

 M obsproc_dump_post/sorc/setlibs.rc
 M obsproc_dump_post/ush/bufr_datacount.sh
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 Model script changes:
   exdump_post.sh.ecf:
    - Updated to run on Cray-XC40 (as well as IBM iDataPlex).
    - Environment variable $SITE or getsystem.pl are used to determine if
      running on Cray-XC40.
    - Added MPMD methods to run lister threads in parallel and eliminated use of
      common background processes.
    - New variable MPMD determines whether to run dump lister threads in
      parallel or serially.  (default: MPMD=YES -> parallel)
    - If running on IBM iDataPlex and dump listings are to be generated, the
      command file processor utility (cfp) is required if MPMD=YES.
    - If running on Cray-XC40, and MPMD=YES, the dump lister threads are
      launched in parallel by using cfp via aprun if cfp is in the command path.
      If cfp command cannot be found, aprun will launch up to 24 processes in
      "background" mode on a single compute node.  If there are more then 24
      dump threads in this latter case, some will be combined to make 24
      processes.
    - The sequence of dump types in the listdumps section has been modified to
      process longer running types first.  This was done to improve efficiency
      if there are more types passed to cfp than processors allocated.
    - If creating a combined dump status file, it is now sent to $COMOUT rather
      than $COMIN to protect content of $COMIN while testing.

 USH script changes:
   bufr_datacount.sh:
    - Replaced mail command with mail.py utility in order to send dump status
      info to SDM from any node.
    - Modified to set MODEL variable properly for RUN=gdas or RUN=gdas1.

 Source code and build changes (in sorc directory):
   build.sh:
    - Updated to build codes on Cray-XC40 or IBM iDataPlex.
    - For Cray-XC40 builds, FC=ftn is passed to the make command to override the
      the default setting in the makefiles.
    - Use load_libs.rc rather than setlibs.rc to specify libraries.
    - Upgrade from ics/12.1 to ics/16.0.3 for builds on IBM iDataPlex.
   load_libs.rc:
    - Updated for different module naming conventions used on IBM vs Cray-XC40.
   setlibs.rc:
    - Point to appropriate library pathnames when building on IBM vs Cray-XC40.
   README.build:
    - Removed instructions for compiling without the build.sh script.
    - Other cleanup.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
    - Due to the upgrade in ifort compiler version from 12.1 (on IBM) to 16.x.x
      (on Cray and IBM) some printed values in bufr_listdumps informational msgs
      will no longer include a leading zero.


 Libraries:
 ----------
   w3nco   2.0.6 (all)
   w3emc   2.2.0 (bufr_listdumps)
   bufr   11.1.0 (bufr_listdumps)


 Build Instructions:
 -------------------
   - See sorc/README.build


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   There are no jobs in obsproc_dump_post.  All jobs executing this version of
   obsproc_dump_post should be tested.  Note that since background threads are
   no longer used, IBM jobs moving to this version should load the cfp module 
   and use poe bsub directives to run dump lister in parallel (otherwise, set
   MPMD=NO).  


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   See information about dissemination in the latest release notes for
   obsproc_<NETWORK> packages which execute this version of obsproc_dump_post.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v8.0.1
   It should be installed on both WCOSS systems (IBM iDataPlex and Cray-XC40)
   with or prior to obsproc_global.v3.0.0.

   Since there are no jobs in obsproc_dump_post, an obsproc_dump_post.ver
   file is not needed.

obsproc_dump_post release 2.3.0 --> released Jan 12, 2017
                                --> implemented Feb 21, 2017

 M obsproc_dump_post/ush/bufr_datacount.sh
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 Model script changes:
   exdump_post.sh.ecf:
    - Added "NC004011" and "NC004103" in dump file "aircft" and "NC021242" in
      (just added) dump file "saphir" (present in GFS/GDAS) to the list of Table
      A entries for BUFR messages which contain all restricted reports in
      BUFR_REMOREST processing.
      BENEFIT: The non-restricted "aircft" dump files will not contain Korean-
               AMDAR or catch-all AMDAR reports (all from BUFR-feed) once they
               are part of the "aircft" dump group.  Will generate a non-
               restricted "saphir" dump file which contains no reports.  These
               files are written to public servers.
    - Added some descriptive comments and made some existing comments more
      descriptive.  Comments in BUFR_AVGDATA processing also updated to account
      for fact that NAM can run at time marks other than tm00 after NAMv4
      implementation (only tm00 expected here).

 USH script changes:
   bufr_datacount.sh:
    - Minor comment and echo changes to account for fact that NAM can run at
      time marks other than tm00 after NAMv4 implementation (only tm00 expected
      here).
    - Add $tmmark qualifier to end of dump alert flag files created here which
      contain RC's and to end of dump alert log files which contain information
      (makes sense since after NAMv4 implementation NAM can have different
      $tmmark values, even though this script will still run only at tm00 time
      mark).
      (Note: Will still write RC's to legacy dump alert flag filenames until
             JDUMP_ALERT is transitioned to read from new filenames, and will
             still write information to legacy dump alert log filenames until
             such time that the filename change can be advertised.)

 Source code changes:
   bufr_datacount:
    - Minor changes to account for fact that NAM can run at time marks other
      than tm00 after NAMv4 implementation (only tm00 expected here).
   bufr_listdumps:
      listdumps.f (main program):
       - Updated to properly list three new aircraft types (if in "aircft"
         dump):
           - TAMDAR aircraft data from Panasonic/AirDAT originating from BUFR.
              - Includes listing of "observer identification" (OBSVR).
              - Includes listing of "type of commercial aircraft" (ACTP).
              - Includes listing of instantaneous altitude rate (IALR).
           - Korean AMDAR originating from BUFR.
           - All AMDAR types other than European, Canadian and Korean
             originating from BUFR (referred to as "Catch-all" AMDAR).
              - Includes listing of "aircraft flight number" (ACID).
         BENEFIT: Allows newly available aircraft data to be listed from the
                  "aircft" dump in an easy-to-read format.
       - All references to E-ADAS have been changed to E-AMDAR.
       - Corrected info in "KEY FOR DATA LISTED" printout for AIRCFT types.
       - Reads new output real, double-precision argument arrays ADATA_8 and
         RDATA8_8, both of length 2, in calls to IW3UNPBF and  and W3UNPKB7,
         resp. (see changes to these subroutines below, there array is OBS8_8).
         This returns latitude and longitude for each report which is then
         stored in R*8 variables ALAT_8 and ALON_8 prior to listing for the
         following dump types: AIRCFT, AIRCAR and ADPUPA in subr. LISTUPA (here
         format changed to list 5 significant digits instead of 2); ADPSFC,
         SFCSHP and MSONET in subr. LISTSFC (here format changed to list 5
         significant digits instead of 4); ASCATW in subr. LISTQKSWND (here
         format changed to list 5 significant digits instead of 2); and GPSIPW
         in subr. LISTGPSIPW (already lists to 5 significant digits).
         BENEFIT: Replaces lat/lon returned in ADATA(1:2) and RDATA(1:2) in
                  calls to IW3UNPBF and W3UNPKB7, resp. for these types, which
                  are just at machine precison (normally R*4).  Now that reports
                  in these dumps can store lat/lon at 0.00001 degree precision
                  (e.g., AIRCFT and AIRCAR dumps with switch to v7 BUFR), this
                  change will ensure that lat/lon is always accurate to 0.00001
                  degrees in these listings.
       - Output print statements for listings from AIRCAR and AIRCFT dumps
         formatted to accommodate increased precision in moisture (here format
         changed to list 6 significant digits instead of 3).
         BENEFIT: This precision now found in moisture data in these dumps with
                  switch to v7 BUFR.
      iw3unpbf.f (subroutine) (all but last change are primarily in function
      R05UBF):
       - Read in and store moisture from E-AMDAR aircraft type.
         BENEFIT: Will be tested for eventual assimilation.
       - Processes three new aircraft types (if in "aircft" dump):
           - TAMDAR aircraft data from Panasonic/AirDAT originating from BUFR
             (dumped from tank b004/xx010).
              - Gets dump report subtype 10.
              - Stores instantaneous altitude rate (read from IALR) in cat.8
                c.f. 932 (.001 x m/sec).
              - Accounts for missing bulletin header (BUHD) and originator
                (BORG) and does not attempt to store these in output C*11
                CBULLX.
              - Stores tail number as report id.
              - Temperature obtained from mnemonic TMDBST in dump file.
                Moisture obtained from mnemonic RAWHU.
              - Will not set temperature QM to purge if wind QM is set to purge
                by SDM.
              - Stores type of commercial aircraft (read from ACTP) in header
                reserve character (*8) word 2.
              - Stores observer identification (read from OBSVR) in bytes 1-4 of
                header reserve character (*8) word 1.
              - Quality marks for temperature (TQM) and wind (WQM) output from
                this subroutine are derived from quality information provided by
                QMRKH fields in the input dump reports if not previously purged
                by the SDM. The quality mark for moisture is derived from the
                "percent confidence" (PCCF) field provided in the dump reports
                if not previously purged by the SDM.
                   - Always set moisture quality mark (QQM) to 13 if temperature
                     quality mark (TQM) was set to 13 earlier (regardless of
                     value for PCCF).
           - Korean AMDAR originating from BUFR (dumped from tank b004/xx011).
              - Gets dump report subtype 11.
              - Stores tail number as report id.
           - All AMDAR types other than European, Canadian and Korean
             originating from BUFR (referred to as "Catch-all" AMDAR) (dumped
             from tank b004/xx103).
              - Gets dump report subtype 103.
              - Stores tail number as report id.
              - Stores flight number (read from ACID) in header reserve
                character (*8) word 2 (if ACID is missing, stores all blanks
                here).  If tail number is missing and this is not, store flight
                number as report id.
       - Processes AMDAR ["Catch-all" (if in "aircft" dump) and Euopean] and
         MCDRS reports originating from new version 7 (v7) BUFR. (Can still
         process reports from legacy BUFR.)
            - Since v7 MDCRS no longer report pressure, must calculate it from
              report altitude via US Std. Atmos. function in order to estimate
              dew point to perform a gross check on moisture data. Also used for
              this same purpose for E-AMDARs now that their moisture can be
              processed and for new TAMDARs which alos have moisture.
            - Adjusted code to accommodate the more-detailed phase of flight
              information for v7 BUFR stored in mnemonic DPOF in dump files,
              rather than the less-detailed version stored in mnemonic POAF in
              the legacy BUFR dump files.  Logic added to translate DPOF values
              into POAF prior to storing in cat.8 c.f. 914.  Downstream codes
              still expect this to contain less-detailed phase of flight
              information as defined by POAF.
       - All references to E-ADAS have been changed to E-AMDAR.
       - In final height level assignment for aircraft reports, a check for
         FLVLST (flight-level, std. resolution) is added but this is given
         lowest priority amongst the height/altitude variables checked. Needed
         because This is the only height variable stored by new Korean and
         "Catch-all" AMDAR types.  It is also stored for the new TAMDAR reports
         (defined as GPS altitude), but HMSL (defined as pressure altitude) is
         also stored for these and is used for final height asignment for
         TAMDARs (FLVLST is currently not stored in output for TAMDARs).
       - Added new output real, double-precision argument array OBS8_8 of length
         2 to return full-precision latitude and longitude for a report.
         BENEFIT: Although lat and lon are returned in OBS(1:2) these are at
                  machine precison, which is normally R*4.  Now that many
                  reports in the dumps store lat/lon at 0.001 or even 0.00001
                  degree precision, and now that PREPBUFR encodes YOB (lat) and
                  XOB (lon) at 0.00001 degree precision, this change will ensure
                  that lat/lon is always accurate to 0.00001 degrees in all
                  downstream processing.
      w3unpkb7.f (subroutine):
       - Added new output real, double-precision argument array RDATA8_8 of
         length 2 to return full-precision latitude and longitude for a report.
         BENEFIT: See BENEFIT for last change in subroutine iw3unpbf.f above.

 Model script changes:
   exdump_post.sh.ecf:
    - Use NCO-established variables (presumably obtained from modules) to point
      to prod utilities:
       - $NDATE from module prod_util (default or specified version, loaded in
         each network which executes this script in this version of
         obsproc_prep_post) which replaces executable ndate in non-versioned,
         horizontal structure utility directory path defined by imported
         variable $utilexec.
    - Added "NC012004" in dump file "gpsipw" to the list of Table A entries for
      BUFR messages which can contain a mixture of restricted and unrestricted
      reports.
      BENEFIT: Will generate a non-restricted "gpsipw" dump file which contains
               only foreign-provided (GNSS) reports.  This file can then be
               written to public servers.  All U.S.-provided (ENI) reports are
               restricted and are stripped out of this non-restricted file.
               The "gpsipw" listing file will also be restricted.

 USH script changes:
   bufr_datacount.sh:
    - Modified sed commands to allow for more generalized search matches.
    - Use NCO-established variables to point to root directories for main
      software components and input/output directories in order to run on WCOSS
      Phase 1 or Phase 2:
       - $COMROOT which replaces hardwire to "/com".

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - Increased likelihood of consistent builds by purging currently loaded
      environment modules and loading specific compiler module.  The
      default ibmpe module is then loaded for codes that might need it.
    - Switch from using setlibs.rc to load_libs.rc (which loads library
      modules).
    - If environment variable $clobber is exported to this script with value
      "clobber_no", then the "make clobber" step is skipped. If $clobber not
      imported, "make clobber" will proceed as before.
      BENEFIT: This may be useful if one is debugging only one source code
               within a program with multiple source codes.
   README.build in sorc directory:
    - Updated to reflect changes in build.sh (see above).
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the bufrlib version from v10.2.5 to v11.1.0.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the bufrlib version from v10.2.5 to v11.1.0.
    - Point to /nwprod2 copy of all libs managed by NCO.
   bufr_data_count:
      makefile - Removed unneccessary reference to bufrlib variable.
   bufr_listdumps:
      listdumps.f (main program):
       - Listing of total zenith delay from "gpsipw" dump in whole cm is now
         rounded rather than truncated. Listing of hydrostatic delay from
         "gpsipw" dump in whole cm is now rounded rather than truncated. Listing
         from "gpsipw" dump now denotes total zenith delay as "ZTD" rather than
         "TDEL" and error in total zenith delay as "eZTD" rather than as "ETDL".
       - In subr. LISTGPSIPW, now lists lat and lon to nearest 0.00001 degree
         rather than to nearest 0.01 degree.  New WMO format GNSS ground-based
         data (in dump file "gpsipw" under subset 'NC012004) stores CLATH/CLONH
         rather than CLAT/CLON as with previous production non-standard BUFR
         format GPS ground-based data from GSD (had been in dump file "gpsipw"
         under subset 'NC012003).
      iw3unpbf.f (subroutine):
       - Minor comment changes.
      w3unpkb7.f (subroutine):
       - Updated to decode variables specific to the new WMO BUFR format for
         GNSS ground-based data (in dump file "gpsipw" under subset "NC012004").
         BENEFIT: Enables processing of this new, replacement GPS-Met feed.
                  [Note: will still also properly decode variables in previous
                  production non-standard BUFR format GPS ground-based data
                  (when subset "NC012003" was in dump file "gpsipw").]

obsproc_dump_post release 2.0.1 --> released May 1, 2015
                                --> implemented Aug 10, 2015

 M obsproc_dump_post/sorc/load_libs.rc
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 Model script changes:
   exdump_post.sh.ecf:
    - Added new dump type "efclam" to list of dump types whose files that can
      potentially be unblocked.

 Source code changes:
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - remove "module use -a /nwprod/lib/modulefiles" and "module avail"
      BENEFIT: No longer needed and can slow down compilation.
   bufr_listdumps:
      listdumps.f (main program):
       - In subr. LISTUPA, the key of SATWND data listed updated to include new
         instrument type 19 [IR (short-wave) imager automated winds (high
         density)].
       - In subr. LISTUPA, for aircraft report types (only), CBULL (new
         variable returned from IW3UNPBF) is now listed (contains WMO bulletin
         header and originator) in place of header character reserve word 1
         (which only contained WMO bulletin originator in characters 1-4. The
         key for AIRCAR and AIRCFT data updated to reflect this change.
         BENEFIT: This is useful information in the aircraft listings.
       - In subr. LISTGOESNDGS, now correctly lists total cloud cover from GOES
         cloud reports in dump file "goesnd" as the value of TOCC from
         RDATA2(25) passed from W3UNPKB7 (had looked for it in cat 8 c.f. 258
         passed in from W3UNPKB7 in RDATA array but this was changed long ago
         to hold cloud amount and not total cloud cover, and the former is
         missing in GOES cloud reports). RDATA2 is expanded to size 25 in
         W3UNPKB7 in order to store TOCC, and this is accounted for here.
         BENEFIT: Will no longer print TOCC as missing in applicable networks
                  where "goesnd" dump files are listed by this program.
      w3unpkb7.f (subroutine):
       - RDATA2 is expanded to size 25 in order to store total cloud cover
         (TOCC) (present in dumps of GOES cloud reports).
      iw3unpbf.f (subroutine):
       - Added logic to handle new NASA/VIIRS (NPP) POES winds in tank NC005090
         (e.g., recognizes that they now exist, counts of reports with flagged
         QI values, counts of reports by satellite number). Added logic to
         properly handle GOES IR short-wave winds in tank NC005019 (e.g., new
         instrument type 19, process the quality information correctly). Added
         some missing logic which summarizes processing of NESDIS/AVHRR POES
         winds in tank NC005080 (e.g., counts of reports by satellite number).
         BENEFIT: NASA/VIIRS (NPP) POES winds, GOES IR short-wave winds and
                  NESDIS/AVHRR POES winds will all be listed properly from the
                  "satwnd" dumps.
       - Now stores WMO bulletin header and originator in new output
         character*11 argument CBULL for aircraft data (only) (all blanks for
         all other data types for now). (Note: Previously, WMO bulletin
         originator had been stored in characters 1-4 of header reserve
         character word 1 and bulletin header was not stored.)

 Model script changes:
   exdump_post.sh.ecf:
    - Environment variable $REMX (complete path to bufr_remorest executable)
      no longer defaults to /nwprod/exec/bufr_remorest but rather to
      $EXECobsproc_shared_bufr_remorest/bufr_remorest as bufr_remorest package
      has been populated into vertical structure.
    - Modified to change path to ush bufr_remorest.sh from $ushscript_remorest
      to $USHobsproc_shared_bufr_remorest as bufr_remorest package has been
      populated into vertical structure
    - Modified to change path to ush bufr_datacount.sh from
      $ushscript_datacount to $USHobsproc_dump_post.
    - Environment variable $LSTX (complete path to bufr_listdumps executable)
      no longer defaults to /nwprod/exec/bufr_listdumps but rather to
      $EXECobsproc_dump_post/bufr_listdumps.
    - Removed execution of bufr_cword.sh. Since WCOSS transition, all BUFR
      files on WCOSS are already unblocked.  Now copy to *.unblok filenames
      for those users still expecting that naming convention.
    - Added URMA to list of networks for which average tables can be updated.
      BENEFIT: This will allow the URMA to eventually be added to NCO's RTDM
               system.

 USH script changes:
   bufr_datacount.sh:
    - Environment variable $LIST_CNT (complete path to bufr_dumplist fixed
      file) no longer defaults to /nwprod/fix/bufr_dumplist but rather to
      $FIXobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist/bufr_dumplist since bufr_dumplist
      package has previously been populated into vertical structure.
    - Environment variable $DTCX (complete path to bufr_datacount executable)
      no longer defaults to /nwprod/exec/bufr_datacount but rather to
      $EXECobsproc_dump_post/bufr_datacount.
    - Minor syntax correction to eliminate error msg. (No other impact)

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to build one or all executables in the *.fd sub-directories of
      the sorc directory.  Reads either load_libs.rc or setlibs.rc file to
      point to library version numbers needed by makefiles.
   clean.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to "make clean" one or more *.fd sub-directories in the sorc
      directory (generally after a build).
   install.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to install (move) one or more executables (after build) in
      exec directory (assumed to be in same root directory as sorc).
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefiles.  (Not read if setlibs.rc is read.)
   README.build in sorc directory:
    - New. Documentation on using build.sh, install.sh and clean.sh.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefiles.  (Not read if load_libs.rc is read.)
   All source codes:
    - Makefile modified to use environment variables to point to library
      version numbers and to add sample build script and info in sorc
      directory.  This generalizes the library version information.
   bufr_datacount:
    - No change to source.
   bufr_listdumps:
      listdumps:
       - Array ADATA2 returned from IW3UNPBF increased from length 42 to 43
         words, where word 43 contains satellite zenith angle (degrees, SATWND
         types only).
         BENEFIT: This is now listed for SATWND types. 
       - Added option to sort listing of ADPSFC dump by report id (ascending
         order) and within requested obs time (hardwired to not do sorting).
         Aborts with RC=65 if > 40000 ADPSFC reports (exceeds sort limit).
         BENEFIT: Easy for developers to switch on a more user-friendly listing
                  of surface reports.
       - Printing format changed for some types to squeeze more information on
         a line.
       - Changes to allow for listing of new VAD wind reports from level 2
         decoder.
       - Array RDATA returned from W3UNPKB7 increased from 1200 to 2500 words
         (IDATA which is equivalenced to RDATA increased as well).
      iw3unpbf:
       - Added ability to read in and process percent confidence based on
         EUMETSAT Quality Indicator with and without forecast for NESDIS GOES
         winds pulled from NESDIS server (which originally stored them in dump
         file explicitly as "QIFY" and "QIFN" but later stored them both as
         before and as replicated "PCCF" values as with v10 BUFR, and even
         later stored them only as replicated "PCCF" values as with v10 BUFR)
         if they are present.
         (Note: As noted, will also work if these are stored in replicated
                "PCCF" values as with v10 BUFR, e.g., MODIS winds, AVHRR winds,
                JMA winds, EUMETSAT winds.)
       - Added ability to read in and process percent confidence based on
         NESDIS Recursive Filter Function for types which might store it in
         dump file in replicated "PCCF" values as with v10 BUFR (in this case
         NESDIS GOES winds, MODIS winds, AVHRR winds, JMA winds - already in
         place for EUMETSAT winds) if it is present.
         (Note: Will still work if this is stored explicitly as "RFFL" as
                originally with GOES winds pulled from NESDIS server.)
       - Added ability to read in and process percent confidence based on
         NESDIS Expected Error for types which might store it in dump file in
         replicated "PCCF" values as with v10 BUFR (in this case MODIS or AVHRR
         winds) if it is present.
         (Note: Will still work if this is stored explicitly as "EEQF" as
                originally with GOES winds pulled from NESDIS server.
       - Now stores cloud-top/deep-layer indicator in byte 3 of header reserve
         character word 1 for foreign-produced satellite winds (as already done
         for NESDIS-produced satellite winds) - JMA and EUMETSAT imager water
         vapor winds can now be of both types, before they were only cloud-top.
       - Output array OBS2 creased from length 42 to 43 words, where word 43
         contains satellite zenith angle (degrees, SATWND types only)
       - Added new dump report type 534 for surface marine Coast Guard tide
         gauge reports.
         BENEFIT: Now Coast Guard tide gauge reports are available to be
                  listed for all networks that dump SFCSHP data.
      w3unpkb7:
       - Modified to handle VAD wind reports from Level 2 decoder (subset
         "NC002017") in addition to those from Radar Coded Message (subset
         "NC002008")}.
       - Parameterized maximum number of levels allowed for each category and
         calculated parameter "IDMAX" (size of output "RDATA" array) based on
         these.  All of these are now placed in new include file
         'inc_w3unpkb7.inc'.
      inc_w3unpkb7.inc:
       - Maximum number of cat. 04 winds-by-height levels (excluding first,
         surface, level) increased from 64 to 254 to account for more levels in
         new VAD wind reports from Level 2 decoder.
       - Maximum number of cat. 11 wind profiler levels (excluding first,
         surface, level) increased from 102 to 200 to account for some MAP
         profilers with more levels than before.
       - The resulting "IDMAX" is now 2270, up from 1200 before.
