 Source code changes:
   bufr_remorest.fd/remorest.f (main program)
    - Included subset NC001101 in logic section that replaces station
      ID with MASKSTID.
      BENEFIT: BUFR format restricted ships data can be properly
               dispensed to public users.

 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Networks specific sfcshp dump files will include BUFR format 
   restricted ship observations with station ID replaced by MASKSTID.

   This is part of OBSPROC.v16.1.0.
   This can be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of:
      v3.4.2 of obsproc_global,
      v3.4.3 of obsproc_nam,
      v3.2.2 of obsproc_rap,

      v5.5.0 of obsproc_prep,
      v2.4.1 of obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist.
   This must be installed on all WCOSS systems (Cray-XC40, Dell-p3).

 Since there are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest, an
 obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest.ver file is not needed.

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)

 Source code changes:
   bufr_remorest.fd/remorest.f (main program)
    - Added call to bufrlib routine, maxout, to process commercial
      GPS-RO data.  The default message length of 10000 bytes is not
      sufficiently large enough for GPS-RO data.  Maxout is used to 
      set the max message length to 200000 bytes when reading
      data from the NC003010 subset. 
      BENEFIT: Commercial GPS-RO data will be stripped from gpsro
               BUFR dump files for safe public dissemination.

 Output changes:
 ---------------
   All network gpsro BUFR dump files will have a non-restricted BUFR
   dump file. $COMROOT will have two gpsro dump files.  Only the nr
   gpsro dump file will be disseminated to the public.

files added, modified or deleted since last release:
 M obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest/sorc/bufr_remorest.fd/remorest.f
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)

 Source code changes:
   bufr_remorest.fd/remorest.f (main program)
    - Added minutes to print statement everytime a new BUFR message is read.  In
      the case of a PREPBUFR file this is the central (analysis) time (which is
      the same) for every message.  In the case of a DUMP file, this is the
      central dump time for the first (dummy) message read in, the dump file
      creation time for the second (dummy) message read in, and the message
      YYYYMMDDHH (with minutes always zero) for all data messages read in.  The
      minutes are obtained from Section 1 of the message read in via call to
      BUFRLIB routine IUPVS01.
      BENEFIT: Until now, central dump time and PREPBUFR (analysis) time minutes
               was always zero.  However, with the implementation of the new
               RTMA_RU, these times can now also have minutes = 15, 30 or 45
               (since the RTMA_RU runs 4 times per hour). This change allows
               this print statement to reflect this new message time format.
    - Fixed a bug in cases where individual subsets in an input message must be
      read in and checked/updated before being written back out if not rejected
      altogether (see * below for cases). Here code was opening output message
      via OPENMG which does not take into account input message's Section 1
      minutes value (it thus opens a message with default of zero minutes in
      Section 1 date). Updated to call BUFRLIB routine MINIMG in such cases to
      encode non-zero minutes value (previously read in via BUFRLIB routine
      IUPVS01, see first change above) into Section 1 date when OPENMB actually
      does open a new message.
      * - either the input message contains a mixture of restricted and non-
          restricted reports or contains restricted reports which can be made
          non-restricted by masking their id
      BENEFIT: Applies only to PREPBUFR files for RTMA_RU runs at 15, 30 or 45
               minutes past the hour: ensures that all messages in output file
               have the same (correct) center date out to minutes in Section 1
               {rather than messages created via OPENMB (e.g., ADPSFC, SFCSHP in
               RTMA_RU runs) having Section 1 minutes of zero}.

   None.

 Source code and build changes (in sorc directory):
   build.sh:
    - Updated to build codes on Cray-XC40 or IBM iDataPlex.
    - For Cray-XC40 builds, FC=ftn is passed to the make command to override the
      the default setting in the makefiles.
    - Use load_libs.rc rather than setlibs.rc to specify libraries.
    - Upgrade from ics/12.1 to ics/16.0.3 for builds on IBM iDataPlex.
   load_libs.rc:
    - Updated for different module naming conventions used on IBM vs Cray-XC40.
    - Upgrade to bufrlib version from 10.2.5 to 11.1.0.
   setlibs.rc:
    - Point to appropriate library pathnames when building on IBM vs Cray-XC40.
    - Upgrade to bufrlib version from 10.2.5 to 11.1.0.
   README.build:
    - Removed instructions for compiling without the build.sh script.
    - Other cleanup.
   bufr_remorest.fd/remorest.f (main program)
    - Added call of bufrlib routine SETBMISS to set the missing value used for
      bufr reads and writes to 10E8_8.  Function GETBMISS is then used to 
      define variable BMISS rather than using a hardwired value of 10E10. This
      change was made to reduce the risk of integer overflows on both IBM 
      iDataPlex and Cray-XC40.

 USH script changes:
   bufr_remorest.sh:
    - Changed exit value of 555 (which is out of the acceptable range) to 55
      to ensure that the parent script sees the intended value.

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to build executable bufr_remorest in the bufr_remorest.fd sub-
      directory of the sorc directory.  Reads either load_libs.rc or setlibs.rc
      file to point to library version numbers needed by makefile.

    - New. Used to "make clean" bufr_remorest.fd sub-directory in the sorc
      directory (generally after a build).
   install.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to install (move) executable bufr_remorest (after build) in
      exec directory (assumed to be in same root directory as sorc).
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefile.  (Not read if setlibs.rc is read.)

    - New. Documentation on using build.sh, install.sh and clean.sh.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefile.  (Not read if load_libs.rc is read.)
   bufr_remorest:
    - No change to source.
    - Makefile modified to use environment variables to point to library
      version numbers and to add sample build script and info in sorc
      directory.  This generalizes the library version information.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   No changes.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Source code bufr_remorest:
