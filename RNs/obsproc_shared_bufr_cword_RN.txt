 Source code changes:
   load_libs.rc
    - Updated to load bufrlib.v11.3.0

   Source code bufr_cword:
    - link to version 2.0.6 of w3nco library
    - link to version 11.3.0 of bufr library

 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   There are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_cword.  All jobs executing this
   version of obsproc_shared/bufr_cword will be part of the parallel-production
   test.

 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v12.4.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementation of
   obsproc_satingest.v3.10.0.

   Since there are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_cword, an
   obsproc_shared_bufr_cword.ver file is not needed.

 USH script changes:
   bufr_cword.sh:
    - Renamed from cwordsh.
    - Turn on echoing of script commands to stdout (set -x).
    - Changes to handle files now under Vertical Directory Structure:
       - Imports new environment variable $EXECobsproc_shared_bufr_cword which
         points to path for bufr_cword executable now under version control
         (in production this is normally
         /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_cword.vX.Y.Z/exec where X.Y.Z version
         number being used, usually the latest).
         This replaces $utilexec (which had defaulted to production value of
         /nwprod/util/exec) in order to point to bufr_cword executable moved
         from horizontal directory structure (where it was called cwordsh) to
         vertical directory structure.

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to build executable bufr_avgdata in the bufr_avgdata.fd sub-
      directory of the sorc directory.  Reads either load_libs.rc or setlibs.rc
      file to point to library version numbers needed by makefile.
   install.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to install (move) executable bufr_avgdata (after build) in
      exec directory (assumed to be in same root directory as sorc).
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefile.  (Not read if setlibs.rc is read.)
   README.build in sorc directory:
    - New. Documentation on using build.sh and install.sh.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefile.  (Not read if load_libs.rc is read.)
   bufr_cword:
    - Renamed from cwordsh.
    - Increased limit for I/O filename from 120 characters to 500 characters.
    - Makefile modified to use environment variables to point to library
      version numbers and to add sample build script and info in sorc
      directory.  This generalizes the library version information.
    - NOTE: The filename length increase requires that this program always be
            linked with BUFRLIB version 10.2.5 or later when it is recompiled.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
  (For specific network changes see " Output changes" in Release Notes for that
   network, if that network executes this version of
   obsproc_shared/bufr_cword.)


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Source code bufr_cword:
    - continues to link to version 2.0.6 of w3nco library
    - continues to link to version 10.2.5 of bufr library


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   There are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_cword.  All jobs executing this
   version of obsproc_shared/bufr_cword will be part of the parallel-production
   test of the hourly GOES satellite winds.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   See information about dissemination in the latest release notes for
   obsproc_satingest since it now executes this version of
   obsproc_shared/bufr_cword.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v1.0.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of
   obsproc_dump.v3.0.0, obsproc_dump_monitor.v1.0.0, obsproc_global.v1.0.0,
   obsproc_nam.v1.0.0, obsproc_rap.v1.0.0, obsproc_rtma.v1.1.0,
   obsproc_urma.v1.1.0, obsproc_satingest.v2.0.0 and
   obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.0.0.

   It should be implemented PRIOR to NESDIS' promotion of their hourly GOES
   satellite winds to their production server,

   Since there are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_cword, an
   obsproc_shared_bufr_cword.ver file is not needed.
