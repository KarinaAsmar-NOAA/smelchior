 Output changes:
 ---------------
  (For specific network changes see " Output changes" in Release Notes for that
   network, if that network executes this version of
   obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.)


 Libraries:
 ----------

 Build Instructions:
 -------------------
   See sorc/README.build


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   There are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.  All jobs updating to this
   version of obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata should be tested in advance.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   There are no products disseminated by this software unit.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v11.0.0.
   This can be implemented prior to, but no later than, the implementations of:
      v3.2.0 of obsproc_global,
      v3.3.0 of obsproc_nam.
   This can be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of:
      v5.0.0 of obsproc_dump,
      v3.3.0 of obsproc_dump_post,
      v5.2.0 of obsproc_prep,
      v3.1.0 of obsproc_prep_post,
      v2.1.0 of obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest.
   This can also be implemented prior to, but no later than, the FV3 GFS upgrade.
   This must be installed on all WCOSS systems (IBM iDataPlex, Cray-XC40, Dell-p3).

   Since there are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata, an
   obsproc_shared_bufr_avgdata.ver file is not needed.

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 USH script changes:
   bufr_avgdata.sh:
    - Updated to run on both IBM iDataPlex and Cray-XC40.
    - Replaced hardwired pathnames with NCO standard variables.
    - Modified to handle gdas1 or gdas as prefix for input gdas file names
      (in preparation for 2017 GFS upgrade).
    - Added default of empty string for variable jlogfile to eliminate the
      need to toggle the switch that traps references to unset variables.

 Source code and build changes (in sorc directory):
   build.sh:
    - Updated to build codes on Cray-XC40 or IBM iDataPlex.
    - For Cray-XC40 builds, FC=ftn is passed to the make command to override the
      the default setting in the makefiles.
    - Use load_libs.rc rather than setlibs.rc to specify libraries.
    - Upgrade from ics/12.1 to ics/16.0.3 for builds on IBM iDataPlex.
   load_libs.rc:
    - Updated for different module naming conventions used on IBM vs Cray-XC40.
   setlibs.rc:
    - Point to appropriate library pathnames when building on IBM vs Cray-XC40.
   README.build:
    - Removed instructions for compiling without the build.sh script.
    - Other cleanup.

   It should be installed on both WCOSS systems (IBM iDataPlex and Cray-XC40)
   with or prior to obsproc_global.v3.0.0.

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 USH script changes:
   bufr_avgdata.sh:
    - Added tm00 qualifier to all status file copy statements.
      BENEFIT: This adjustment will force the copy of only
               those status files and updated status files
               that were generated for the tm00 cycle runs.
               The tm06-tm01 cycle runs are not considered
               in the bufr_avgdata processing.

 Shared Software:
 ----------------
    - Source code bufr_avgdata:
         links to version 2.0.6 of w3nco library


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   There are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.  All jobs executing this
   version of obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata will be part of the parallel-
   production test of the OBSPROC.v7.0.0 bundle.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   See information about dissemination in the release notes for
   obsproc_nam which executes obsproc_dump_post which in turn
   executes this version of obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v7.0.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of:
      NAM v4.0.0 on Phase 2 and
      obsproc_nam.v3.0.0.

   Since there are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata, an
   obsproc_shared_bufr_avgdata.ver file is not needed.

obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata release 1.0.1 --> released Sep 14, 2014
                                          --> implemented Nov 4, 2014

files added, modified or deleted since last release:
 M obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata/sorc/load_libs.rc
 M obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata/ush/bufr_avgdata.sh
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 USH script changes:
   bufr_avgdata.sh:
    - Adjusted pdy_earliest to keep 32 days of files.
      BENEFIT: This adjustment will circumvent potential RTDM job failures
               due to racing between the gdas_dump_post_18 job and
               the model_realtime_gdas_18 job. The latter needs 31 days
               of data. The former trims to 30 days.
    - Since the archive directory will contain 32 days of files, when
      it formerly contained 30 days of files, the logic has been
      adjusted to average across only the 30 latest files in the
      archive directory, not across all files in the directory.

 Source code changes:
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - remove "module use -a /nwprod/lib/modulefiles" and
             "module avail"
      BENEFIT: No longer needed and can slow down compilation.


 Output changes:

   network, if that network executes this version of
   obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.)

   obsproc_dump_monitor and the other obsproc_<NETWORK> packages which

 Special Instructions:

 USH script changes:
   bufr_avgdata.sh:
    - Updated to add URMA network.
      BENEFIT:  A running 30-day dump count average table can now be generated
               for the URMA network.
    - Environment variable $DUMPLIST (complete path to bufr_dumplist fixed
      file) no longer defaults to /nwprod/fix/bufr_dumplist but rather to
      $FIXobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist/bufr_dumplist.
    - Environment variable $AVGX (complete path to bufr_avgdata executable) no
      longer defaults to /nwprod/exec/bufr_avgdata but rather to
      $EXECobsproc_shared_bufr_avgdata/bufr_avgdata.
    - Updated logic which scrubs "date" directories older than 30 days in
      "$OBCNTarch/<network>" to skip over (and retain) any directories that are
      not named "<network>.YYYYMMDD".
      BENEFIT:  Prior to this, scrubbing would break if a rouge (non-date) file
                or directory was in "$OBCNTarch/<network>".  This happened
                recently when a file called "TAR.tar" was inadvertently placed
                in /com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/gdas.  True date directories
                older than 30 days were no longer scrubbed.  Scrubbing will be
                maintained now in this situation (any rouge files/directories
                will always be retained but NCO should remove them a.s.a.p.).

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to build executable bufr_avgdata in the bufr_avgdata.fd sub-
      directory of the sorc directory.  Reads either load_libs.rc or setlibs.rc
      file to point to library version numbers needed by makefile.
   clean.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to "make clean" bufr_avgdata.fd sub-directory in the sorc
      directory (generally after a build).
   install.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to install (move) executable bufr_avgdata (after build) in
      exec directory (assumed to be in same root directory as sorc).
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefile.  (Not read if setlibs.rc is read.)
   README.build in sorc directory:
    - New. Documentation on using build.sh, install.sh and clean.sh.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefile.  (Not read if load_libs.rc is read.)
   bufr_avgdata:
    - No change to source.
    - Makefile modified to use environment variables to point to library
      version numbers and to add sample build script and info in sorc
      directory.  This generalizes the library version information.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   No changes.


 Compute Resource Information:
