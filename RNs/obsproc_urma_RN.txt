 Model script changes:
   exurma_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Modified dump group 2 subtype counts to keep aligned with the
      updated bufr_dumplist at v2.4.0.
      BENEFIT: sfcshp dump file includes BUFR format ships and cman data.
    - Modified dump group 2 to generate a separate tideg dump file, no
      longer included in the sfcshp dump file.
      BENEFIT: Eliminates duplicate reports complications between the
               two separate data streams: tideg and cmanb.
    - Added logic to copy bufr_dumplist file to $COMOUT.
      BENEFIT: per NCO SPA request.

          $COMROOT/urma/prod/urma.YYYYMMDD/urma.tCCz.sfcshp.tm00.bufr_d,
         will have the tideg subset (NC001005) removed.
       - The tideg dump file,
          $COMROOT/urma/prod/urma.YYYYMMDD/urma.tCCz.tideg.tm00.bufr_d,
         will be new.
    - As a result of updates in obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v2.4.0:
      - The following subsets are now included in the sfcshp dump file:

 JOB script changes:
   JURMA_PREP:
    - Modified to export variable, email_GLERL,  as
      "matthew.t.morris@noaa.gov".  This addresses
      NCO bugzilla #975.
      BENEFIT: The recipient email address can be easily
               changed at the job script level.  The 
               downstream ush script uses the variable
               setting rather than an explicit email address.


 Model script changes:
  exurma_dump.sh.ecf:
   -  Updated Dump group #1 to skip legacy Meteosat AMV
      subsets: 005064, 005065, 005066.  These subsets
      are replaced by new WMO BUFR sequence subsets:
      005067, 005068, 005069.  The format change from
      EUMETSAT occurs Oct 6, 2020.
      BENEFIT: urma dump processing is up to date with
               currently available data sets.

    - Added new variable GLERLBUFR with default setting of "yes" to tell
      obsproc_prep software whether to run PREPOBS_GLERLADJ (GLERL adjustment
      processing) step.
    - A dummy sgesprep file is created in the DATA working directory so as to
      inhibit the unnecessary copying of first guess files, thereby reducing
      processing time (especially important for rtma_ru runs).

 Model script changes:
   exurma_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Added types NC255031 (Urbanet) and NC255101 (COOPmd) to msonet dumps

 JOB script changes:
   JURMA_PREP:
    - Added new variable NEMSIO_IN with default setting of ".true." to tell
      obsproc_prep software whether to pick up nemsio global forecast files
      instead of the older sigio files.
    - Added variables COMINgdas and COMINgfs needed by the version of getges.sh
      used for NEMSIO_IN=.true. (available in obsproc_prep.v4.0.0).
    - Made variable envir_getges substitutable so that it can be imported from
      the parent environment.  (default is "prod")
    - Added wrapper around GETGES_NWG and GETGES_COM variables for the pre- and
      post- GFS upgrade transitional period.
    - Removed load of the util_shared module which is no longer needed with the
      upgrade to obsproc_prep.v4.0.0


 Output changes:

( M - modified)


 JOB script changes:
   All job scripts:
    - Move check that required variables are set to top of script.
   JURMA_DUMP:
    - Points to latest version of obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist in Phase 2 vs.
      Phase 1 ($NWROOTp2 replaces $NWROOTp1; the transitional setting for
      $NWROOTp2 added).
    - Obtains version number for module grib_util via imported environment
      variable $grib_util_ver.  This is now defined in
      /nwprod2/versions/obsproc_urma.ver.
      Current setting is grib_util_ver=v1.0.1.
       - Load module grib_util/v1.0.1.
          - Removed setting of variable EXGRBIX.
      BENEFIT: Defines path now relied on to run utility program grbindex in
               ush script bufr_dump_obs.sh.
    - Remove exported script variable $utilparm (which defaulted to
      /nwprod/util/parm) as it is no longer required by any child scripts.
   JURMA_DUMP_POST:
    - Points to latest version of obsproc_dump_post and
      obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist in Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 ($NWROOTp2 replaces
      $NWROOTp1; the transitional setting for $NWROOTp2 added).
    - More flexible options for specifiying variable $AVGDarch_OUT in developer
      runs.
   JURMA_PREP:
    - Obtains version number for module util_shared via imported environment
      variable $util_shared_ver.  This is now defined in
      /nwprod2/versions/obsproc_urma.ver.
      Current setting is util_shared_ver=v1.0.4.
       - Load module util_shared/v1.0.4.
      BENEFIT: Defines prepended path now relied on to run utility ush
               getges.sh in ush script prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh.
      Note: Exported script variables GETGES_COM and GETGES_NWG are retained
            with no changes since they now always override getges.sh defaults
            of "$COMROOT" and "$GESROOT", resp. in module util_shared/v1.0.4
            version of utility ush getges.sh.  This gives flexibility for cases
            when a development or test run may redirect COMROOT or GESROOT to
            an alternate location. It also avoids the need to set GETGES_COM or
            GETGES_NWG in the driver script in this case.  Also allows
            GETGES_COM or GETGES_NWG to be set to an alternative location in
            driver script.
    - Replaces generic $NWROOT with more specific $NWROOTp2 as root to
      obsproc_prep in Phase 2 (the transitional setting for $NWROOTp2 added).
   JURMA_PREP_POST:
    - Points to latest version of obsproc_prep_post in Phase 2 vs. Phase 1
      ($NWROOTp2 replaces $NWROOTp1; the transitional setting for $NWROOTp2
      added).
   JURMA_PREP, JURMA_PREP_POST:
    - Remove exported script variable $utilexec (which defaulted to
      /nwprod/util/exec) as it is no longer required by any child scripts.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepdata.urma.parm:
    - The default overrides for AWINDO, JAMASS, JAWIND, IACFTL and FLACMS are
      extended to accommodate three additional aircraft data types: Korean AMDAR
      (BUFR), AMDAR-catchall (BUFR) and Panasonic (AirDAT) TAMDAR (BUFR).  There
      were six, now there are nine.  The three new types get the same values as
      previously existing AMDAR types. These three new aircraft data types, like
      all aircraft types, will not be processed and thus not included in the
      PREPBUFR files.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JURMA_DUMP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump.v3.3.0:
       - Mesonet (msonet) dump files can now contain reports with purged/
         rejected QMs on p,t,q,uv.
   Job JURMA_DUMP_POST:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v2.3.0:
       - Listings for "adpsfc", "sfcshp", "msonet" and "ascatw" dumps now print
         lat/lon out to 0.00001 degree (although actual significance is still
         based on precision in the BUFR lat/lon encoded in each dump file).
   Job JURMA_PREP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.8.0:
       - PREPBUFR files now store lat/lon (YOB/XOB) to 10**5 precision, this
         will potentially be seen for the following type: MSONET 188/288 since
         this has 10**5 precision in dumps.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Job JURMA_DUMP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump.v3.3.0:
       - program bufr_edtbfr uses more memory due to an increase in array parameter
         "ISTNID_MATCH":
               previous: The maximum resident set size (KB) = 239108
               now:      The maximum resident set size (KB) = 258952
       - Changes in program bufr_edtbfr result in a ~20 second increase in
         wallclock run time.
    - No change in requested resources in the job cards.
   Job JURMA_DUMP_POST:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v2.3.0:
       - program bufr_listdumps uses a bit more memory due to now passing
         double-precision latitude/longitude.
    - No change in requested resources in the job cards.
    - No change in wallclock run time.
   Job JURMA_PREP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.8.0:
       - program prepobs_prepdata uses a bit more memory due to now passing
         double-precision latitude/longitude.

 JOB script changes:
   All JOB scripts:
    - Revised logic that generates version informational output at the start of
      the job for cleaner script and output.
    - Removed NCO vs developer checks in places were we could rely on variables 
      set in ecflow environment for NCO runs. Modified remaining such wrappers 
      to check setting of NCO standard variable RUN_ENVIR in place of 
      non-standard variables used previously.
    - Use NCO-established variables to point to root directories for main
      software components and input/output directories in order to run on
      WCOSS Phase 1 or Phase 2.  (Some util* variables remain and point to
      /nwprod/util as required by obsproc application scripts).
    - Removed direct path to setpdy.sh utility script, relying on versions
      added to PATH (presumably by prod_util module).
      NOTE: explicit path to setup.sh utility script remains so as to be
            compatible w/ potential future removal of this utility (this is a
            temporary arrangement until child obsproc scripts that require
            this utility are updated).
    - Use new NCO standard variable KEEPDATA in place of CLEANUP to decide
      whether to remove working directory at end of run.
    - Use NCO-established variables to point to prod utilities.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JURMA_PREP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.6.0:
       - Surface land METAR reports now contain an additional, new CEILING 
         field, derived from cloud amount and cloud height values.

   This is part of OBSPROC.v6.2.0b.
   - It is expected that this will be implemented simultaneously with the
     implementation of the FY16Q4 (or later) URMA Upgrade (v2.4.3).  However,
     it could go in sooner.  Please note, however:
     - This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementation of
       v3.6.0 of obsproc_prep.
     - This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementation of
       v2.1.0 of obsproc_rtma.
     - This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementation of
       v2.1.0 of obsproc_rap.
   - If implementing on WCOSS Phase 1 (prior to move of URMA to run on
     Phase 2), please export the following for all jobs:
       NWROOT=/nwprod
       COMROOT=/com
   - The move of RTDM files for all models to /com2 is expected to come at a
     later date. When that time comes, copy the following from /com to /com2:
       /com/arch/prod/avgdata/obcount_30davg.urma.current
       /com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/urma
     UNTIL THEN, temporarily add:
       export HOMEarch=/com/arch/${envir}
      to ecflow scripts for JURMA_DUMP_POST.

   If implementing on WCOSS Phase 1 (prior to move of URMA to run on Phase 2):

 JOB script changes:
   JURMA_PREP:
    - Added GETGES_COM with default of /com2 to override getges.sh default.
      BENEFIT: Overrides default value "/com" still in util ush getges.sh.
               Needed once GFS moves to Phase 2 (presumably at the same time
               this release is implemented).  Ecflow scripts for JRAP_PREP can
               override this if necessary.
    - Added GETGES_NWG with default of /nwges2 to override getges.sh default.
      BENEFIT: Overrides default value "/nwges" still in util ush getges.sh.
               Needed once GFS moves to Phase 2 (presumably at the same time

      -0.01 hours about center dump time.
      BENEFIT: Will match dump window for other GOES types, providing a single
               hourly set for each GOES satellite, closest to center dump time.
    - Dump new type "efclam" (GOES imager effective cloud amount from U. Wisc.)
      in a time window of +/- 0.5 hours about dump center time.
      BENEFIT: These dumps (from tank b012/xx160) will eventually be read by
               the URMA GSI, replacing the BUFR files output to
               /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/wtxtbul which are now used by the
               URMA GSI. Those files are created in satingest job JIGOES_CLOUD
               and are just a 1:1 translation of each input file to BUFR.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepdata.urma.parm:
    - Minor comment changes.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JURMA_DUMP:
    - New "efclam" dump files will be produced.
    - As a result of update to obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.2.0:
       - The "satwnd" dump files will contain GOES IR/SW, POES AVHRR/IR/LW and
         POES VIIRS/IR/LW winds.
   Job JURMA_PREP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.5.0:
       - Marine reports previously, incorrectly deemed over land and flagged
         will now be deemed over water and be available for assimilation.

 JOB script changes:
   All JOB scripts:
    - Require that the developer export their own particular temporary
      directory root ($DATAROOT) into the job scripts. If $DATAROOT is not set
      in these scripts, the script will abort.
      NOTE: This does not affect production.
      BENEFIT: This avoids having to hardwire a development-specific default
               temporary directory root in these job scripts. This can now be
               different for different development groups.
   JURMA_DUMP_POST:
    - Obtains obsproc_urma, obsproc_dump_post, obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest,
      obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata and obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist version
      numbers via imported environment variables $obsproc_urma_ver,
      $obsproc_dump_post_ver, $obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest_ver,
      $obsproc_shared_bufr_avgdata_ver and $obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver,
      resp.  These are defined in the upstream ecflow script.
    - Full environmental equivalence.  Streamlined, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for developer runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_dump_post which points to
      directory path for generic dump_post subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_dump_post.$obsproc_dump_post_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir}
      in order to point to files in scripts and exec directories moved from
      horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exported environment variable $HOMEobsproc_urma renamed to
      $HOMEobsproc_network to allow for more generality in child scripts.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_remorest which
      points to directory path for generic shared bufr_remorest subdirectories
      under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest.${obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_avgdata which
      points to directory path for generic shared bufr_avgdata subdirectories
      under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.${obsproc_shared_bufr_avgdata_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist which
      points to directory path for generic shared bufr_dumplist subdirectories
      under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.${obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in fix directory moved
      from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
   JURMA_PREP:
    - Obtains obsproc_urma and obsproc_prep version numbers via imported
      environment variables $obsproc_urma_ver (changed from $model_ver) and
      $obsproc_prep_ver.  These are defined in the upstream ecflow script.
    - Full environmental equivalence. Additional streamlining, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_prep which points to
      directory path for generic prep subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally /nwprod/obsproc_prep.$obsproc_prep_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec, fix and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exported environment variable $HOMEobsproc_urma renamed to
      $HOMEobsproc_network to allow for more generality in child scripts.
   JURMA_PREP_POST:
    - Obtains obsproc_urma, obsproc_prep_post and obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest
      version numbers via imported environment variables $obsproc_urma_ver,
      $obsproc_prep_post_ver and $obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest_ver, resp.
      These are defined in the upstream ecflow script.
    - Full environmental equivalence.  Streamlined, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for developer runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_prep_post which points to
      directory path for generic prep_post subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_prep_post.$obsproc_prep_post_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir}
      in order to point to files in scripts directory moved from horizontal to
      vertical directory structure.
    - Exported environment variable $HOMEobsproc_urma renamed to
      $HOMEobsproc_network to allow for more generality in child scripts.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_remorest which
      points to directory path for generic shared bufr_remorest subdirectories
      under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest.${obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepdata.urma.parm:
    - Removed comments related to version number, implementation date, and/or
      history.  No longer needed now that this file is in subversion.
    - New 12'th surface type (representing Coast Guard data) added to arrays
      JSURFW (=0) and FWINDO (=050.).
      BENEFIT: Coast guard mass and wind data now processed and available for
               analysis.
    - New switch NPKRPT (12*TRUE) to control processing of surface obs with
      missing pressure information.  TRUE here means all of the following:
         - Will process surface reports that would otherwise be tossed due to
           their having a missing pstn.
         - These reports estimate pstn from the reported or U.S. Standard
           Atmosphere pmsl, the reported or U.S. Standard Atmosphere sensible
           temperature, and the reported elevation (only marine reports > 7.5 m
           can have a reported pmsl and fall into this category). This
           estimated pstn (POB) is used to estimate q (QOB).  Both POB and QOB
           are assigned minimum q.m.'s (PQM, QQM) of 3. This estimated POB is
           encoded into PREPBUFR file.
         - These reports are then assigned new PREPBUFR report types 192/292
           (SYNOP), 193/293 (METAR), 194/294 (marine) and 195/295 (mesonet).
         - ATLAS buoy wind reports which also have missing pstn and pmsl will
           continue to be processed as before (PREPBUFR report type 282
           (Note: This means that if an ATLAS buoy ever had T,q info, its mass
                  piece would still be tossed rather than getting into PREPBUFR
                  file under under report type 194 (may need to fix this logic
                  someday).
         - MESONETS will no longer have "x" in character 8 of id, instead they
           will get PREPBUFR report types 195/295 rather than 188/288.
      BENEFIT: ADPSFC, SFCSHP, and MSONET reports that do not contain station
               pressure information are now retained (previously, they were
               discarded) and are available for the analysis.
    - New namelist switch DOPMSL (=TRUE) in PREVENTS (gblevents) processing
      to derive pmsl (mnemonic "PMO") from reported station pressure ("POB"),
      station height/elevation ("ZOB") and computed virtual temperature for
      surface reports in cases when pmsl initially encoded in PREPBUFR file by
      prepobs_prepdata is missing (including all mesonet reports).  The derived
      pmsl either gets a quality mark ("PMQ") of 3 or inherits the station
      pressure quality mark ("PQM"), whichever is greater.  The value of the
      pmsl indicator (new mnemonic "PMIN") is set to 1 to denote pmsl was
      derived rather than observed.
      BENEFIT: More complete and thorough pressure information for surface data
               is available in the URMA GSI via this derived pmsl since many
               more reports will have a pmsl now (whether observed or derived).
               The URMA GSI analyzes Pmsl.
    - Changed switch IRNMRK from 9 to 10.
      BENEFIT: Allows URMA to have its own RUN mark value, instead of combining
               it with the RTMA value of 9.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Jobs JURMA_DUMP_POST:
    - Daily dump count status files will be written into directories
      /com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/urma/urma.<yyyymmdd>.  On the day of
      implementation only 2 days will be stored here.  This will then grow by
      1 day each day until 30 days are populated.  At that point, only the most
      recent 30 days will be stored here.  This database will be used to
      generate the new URMA dump count average table in
      /com/arch/prod/avgdata/obcount_30davg.urma.current (so it will take 30
      days until this table holds realistic monthly means).
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v2.0.0:
       - Printing format changed slightly in some dump listing files in
         /com/urma/prod/... directories to squeeze more information on a line.
       - Satellite zenith angle (degrees) added to satwnd dump listing files in
         /com/urma/prod/... directories
       - Coast Guard tide gauge reports added to sfcshp dump listing files in
         /com/urma/prod/... directories
   Job JURMA_PREP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.0.0:
       - Surface reports with missing pressure will now be stored in report
         types 192/292 (SYNOP), 193/293 (METAR), 194/294 (marine) and 195/295
         (msonet) in PREPBUFR file.
       - Coast guard surface marine mass and wind data will now be processed as
         part of report types 194/294 (when pressure is unavailable) or 180/280
         (when pressure is available) in PREPBUFR file.
       - Estimated pmsl (PMO) with qm (PMQ) of 3 will now be encoded in
         PREPBUFR file for surface reports where it is missing and can be
         calculated.  The pmsl indicator (PMIN) is set to 1 in this case (set
         to 0 for reported PMO).
       - Satellite zenith angle (degrees) encoded into PREPBUFR file (mnemonic
         "SAZA") for all satwnd types.
       - Surface marine reports will now encode pmsl ob and qc (PMO and PMQ) in
         PREPBUFR file if pmsl is reported.
       - SFCSHP reports with calm winds and non-missing background u- or v-
         component wind .ge. 5 m/sec are flagged with Q.M. 8 in PREPBUFR file.
       - Surface reports with incomplete wind information will now be retained
         and encoded into the PREPBUFR file.
       - Report type 183 now stores moisture quality mark no lower than 3
         (suspect).

 Model script changes:
   exurma_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Modified to dump GOES IR, water vapor, and visible satellite-derived
      winds using a time window of -1.00 to -0.01 hours relative to cycle time
      for the URMA, rather than -2.50 to +0.50 hours relative to cycle time.
      BENEFIT: NESDIS is changing the frequency of their GOES satellite
               derived winds from 3-hourly to 1-hourly. The change to
               exurma_dump.sh.ecf will allow one complete wind set to be dumped
               and assimilated at every cycle time (not changing the time
               window could at least triple the number of winds assimilated at
               some cycles, all over the same locations). This change will also
               allow winds closer to cycle time to now be assimilated.

 JOB script changes:
   JURMA_DUMP, JURMA_DUMP_POST, JURMA_PREP, JURMA_PREP_POST:
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
   JURMA_DUMP:
    - Obtains obsproc_dump and obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist version numbers via
      imported environment variables $obsproc_dump_ver and
      obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver, resp.  These are defined in the
      upstream ecflow script.
    - Full environmental equivalence.  Additional streamlining, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_dump which points to
      directory path for generic dump subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally /nwprod/obsproc_dump.$obsproc_dump_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec, fix and ush
      directories moved from to horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variables $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist and
      $FIXobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist which point to directory path for
      bufr_dumplist fixed file under version control (in production the latter
      is normally
   /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.$obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver/fix).
      Replaces /nw${envir}/fix from old horizontal directory structure.
    - Exported environment variable $HOMEobsproc_urma renamed to
      $HOMEobsproc_network to allow for more generality in child scripts.
   JURMA_PREP:
    - New variable ushscript_prep added, directory path to ush script
      prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh (currently set to old path $ushscript, done in
      preparation for future transition to obsproc_prep in VS/EE).

 Model script changes:
   exurma_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Modified to turn off the attempt to dump "wndsat" data.
      BENEFIT: The WindSat scatterometer data ingest feed is currently broken
               as these data are now being produced under a new format that
               NCEP does not recognize.  As we transition to the new feed,
               we do not want to inadvertently dump these data in operations.
   exurma_makeprepbufr:
    - Now imports variable ushscript_prep as directory path to ush script
      prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh insread of ushscript.

 Parm file changes:
   wave_dcodascat.urma.parm:
    - New. Overrides default herefile inside obsproc_dump/ush/bufr_dump_obs.sh
      in order to turn off processing of METOP-B ASCAT reports (GSI not ready
      for them).
