obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist release 2.4.0 --> released Jul ??, 2021
                                           --> implemented ??? ??, 2021

 M obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist/fix/bufr_dumplist
 D obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist/modulefiles/bufr_dumplist/2.3.1
 A obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist/modulefiles/bufr_dumplist/2.4.0
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)

 Fixed file changes:
   - bufr_dumplist
    1) Add BUFR type 001, subtype 104 to dump group mnemonics "cmanb",
       "sfcshp", "sfmar", and "001".
    2) Remove subset 001005 from "sfcshp" dump group.
    3) Remove legacy Meteosat tanks from "satwnd" dump group.
  BENEFIT:
    - Change 1 supports the processing of BUFR format ship and cman platform
      data.
    - Change 2 promotes an indiviudal tideg dump file.  Pulling tide gauge
      data from the sfcshp dump file prevents tideg data from being encoded
      into the prepbufr file.  This prevents duplication of data from the
      tideg and cmandb data streams.
    - Change 3 prevents the attempt to dump non-existent BUFR tank files.


 Module changes:
 ---------------
   2.4.0 replaces 2.3.1 in directory modulefiles/bufr_dumplist:
    - Accounts for new version number here.
    BENEFIT:
      Set environment variable HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist for use
      by dumpjb or other utilities that make use of the bufr_dumplist
      text file.

 Dissemination:
 --------------
   See information about dissemination in the latest release notes for
   obsproc_<NETWORK> packages which execute this version of
   obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This should be implemented on BOTH WCOSS IBM Phase 2, and Cray.  It does not
   have to be implemented on WCOSS IBM Phase 1 because obsproc_dump.v4.0.0 is
   now implemented and dumpjb here has been modified to determine the location
   of bufr_dumplist [/gpfs/hps/nco/ops/nwprod (Cray) vs. /nwprod2 (IBM Ph. 2)]
   based on the version number the wrapper script provides to it (if that,
   indeed, is what the wrapper script is providing to point to the bufr_dumplist
   file - never the case in production).

   - Please copy modulefiles/bufr_dumplist/1.5.0 from this release to:
       /gpfs/hps/nco/ops/nwprod/modulefiles/bufr_dumplist/1.5.0
     and:
       /nwprod2/modulefiles/bufr_dumplist/1.5.0
   - When adding to nwtest or nwpara, please remember to modify the envir
     variable in the modulefile accordingly.

   This is part of OBSPROC.v8.0.4.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementation of:
      obsproc_global.v3.1.0
   and either simultaneously with or after the implementation of:
      v3.4.2 of obsproc_satingest.

 Fixed file changes:

     1) Add the following new single dump mnemonics for existing tank types:
  "dbuoyb" [Drifting buoys (decoded from BUFR), type 001, subtype 102]
  "mbuoyb" [Moored buoys (decoded from BUFR), type 001, subtype 103]

  "cnc2al" (CNES CRYOSAT-2 OGDR OGDR altimeter SSHA + wind/wave high-resolution
            global, type 031, subtype 123)
  "cnj3al" (CNES/NESDIS JASON-3 OGDR OGDR altimeter SSHA + wind/wave high-
            resolution global, type 031, subtype 124)

     2) Add BUFR type 001, subtypes 102 and 103 to dump group mnemonics "sfmar"
        and "001".

     3) Add BUFR type 031, subtypes 122, 123 and 124 to dump group mnemonics
        "ocean" and "031".

     4) Update "Descriptive Information" for single dump mnemonic "tmdara".

     5) Add BUFR type 004, subtypes 010, 011 and 103 to dump group mnemonic
        "aircft".

     6) Remove BUFR type 004, subtypes 008, 012 and 013 from dump group mnemonic
        "aircft".

  BENEFIT:
    Changes 1, 2 and 3 are being made to account for data types currently in the
production databases.
    Changes 5 and 6 allow the "aircft" dumps to, by default, include active
types "TAMDAR aircft data from Panasonic", "Korean AMDAR aircraft" and
"catch-all AMDAR aircraft (decoded from BUFR)"; and to now exclude obsolete
types "TAMDAR Mesaba", "TAMDAR PenAir" and "TAMDAR Chautauqua" aircraft, all
from ESRL/GSD (and decoded from netCDF).


 Module changes:
 ---------------
   1.4.0 in new directory modulefiles/bufr_dumplist:
    - New. Can be loaded to set environment variable
      HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist for use by dumpjb or other utilities
      that make use of the bufr_dumplist text file.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
  (For specific network changes see " Output changes" in Release Notes for that
   network, if that network executes this version of
   obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.)


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   There are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.  All jobs executing this
   version of obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist should be tested.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   See information about dissemination in the latest release notes for
   obsproc_<NETWORK> packages which execute this version of
   obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This should be implemented on BOTH WCOSS Phase 1, WCOSS Phase 2, and Cray. 
   The implementation needs to be made on Phase 1 because dumpjb in
   obsproc_dump (which is not part of this bundle) is hardwrired  to look
   for bufr_dumplist in /nwprod if only the version number is provided
   (this is for wrapper scripts running dumpjb outside the normal
   obsproc_<network> in production).  dumpjb will be modified in the next release
   of obsproc_dump (v4.0.0) to determine the location of bufr_dumplist (/nwprod vs.
   /nwprod2) based on the version number the wrapper script provides to it (if
   that, indeed, is what the wrapper script is providing to point to the
   bufr_dumplist file - never the case in production).  Once that update to
   dumpjb in obsproc_dump is implemented, this latest version of bufr_dumplist
   can be removed from Phase 1.

   - Please copy modulefiles/bufr_dumplist/1.4.0 from this release to:
       /gpfs/hps/nco/ops/nwprod/modulefiles/bufr_dumplist/1.4.0
     and:
       /nwprod2/modulefiles/bufr_dumplist/1.4.0
   - When adding to nwtest or nwpara, please remember to modify the envir
     variable in the modulefile accordingly.

   This is part of OBSPROC.v7.1.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of:
      v2.3.0 of obsproc_cdas,
      v2.2.0 of obsproc_dump_monitor,
      v3.1.0 of obsproc_nam,
      v2.4.0 of obsproc_rap.

   Since there are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist, an
   obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist.ver file is not needed.

 Fixed file changes:

     1) Add the following new single dump mnemonics for existing or soon to
exist tank types:
  "ltngen" (Earth Networks Total Lightning Network, type 007, subtype 003)
  "gnss"   (Ground-based Gbl Navigation Sat System data, type 012, subtype 004)
    [Note: Future type "ssmisp" (DMSP SSM/IS - FNOC derived products) had
           occupied this type and subtype, but this is now moved to type 012,
           subtype 006.]
  "escris" (NPP CrIS radiances - direct bcst from RARS , type 021, subtype 037)
  "esatms" (NPP ATMS br. temps - direct bcst from RARS , type 021, subtype 038)
  "esiasi" (METOP IASI radiances-direct bcst from RARS , type 021, subtype 039)
  "crisfs" (NPP CrIS full spectral radiances, type 021, subtype 205)
  "crisdb" (NPP CrIS radiances-direct bcst from UW/SSEC, type 021, subtype 212)
  "atmsdb" (NPP ATMS br. temps-direct bcst from UW/SSEC, type 021, subtype 213)
  "iasidb" (METOP IASI radiances-dir bcast from UW/SSEC, type 021, subtype 239)
  "saphir" (Megha-Tropiques SAPHIR L1A2 bright. temps, type 021, subtype 242)
  "gmi1cr" (GPM GMI Level 1C-R brightness temperatures, type 021, subtype 246)
  "amsr2"  (GCOM-W AMSR2 Level 1B brightness temps, type 021, subtype 248)
  "subgld" (Sub-surface glider profiles, type 031, subtype 005)

     2) Add BUFR type 031, subtype 005 to dump group mnemonics "ocean" and
"031".

     3) Add BUFR type 007, subtype 003 to dump group mnemonics "synfe" and
"007".

     4) Add BUFR type 021, subtypes 037, 038, 039, 205, 212, 213, 239, 242, 246
and 248 to dump group mnemonics "radnc" and "021".

     5) Add BUFR type 012, subtype 006 to dump group mnemonics "sfsat" and
"012".

     6) Change the single dump mnemonic for tank type 012, subtype 255 from
"oscat" to "rscat".  Change the "Data Groups by Network Data Dump Composition"
for tank type 012, subtype 255 (only one in group) from "oscatw" to "rscatw".
The original mnemonics represented OCEANSAT-2 OSCAT products which were never
available in production prior to the loss of the satellite.  The new mnemonics
represent International Space Station (ISS) RAPIDSCAT products which are now
available for testing.

     7) The single dump mnemonic "gpsipw" is changed to represent tank type 012,
subtype 004 rather than tank type 012, subtype 003.

     8) Update "Descriptive Information" for single dump mnemonics "gome",
"ascat" and "mtiasi" to add METOP-1 (in addition to METOP-2).

     9) Update "Descriptive Information" for single dump mnemonics "1bamua",
"1bmhs" and "1bhrs4" to add METOP-1 (in addition to NOAA satellites and
METOP-2).

    10) Update "Descriptive Information" for single dump mnemonics "esamua",
"esamub", "eshrs3" and "esmhs" to add METOP-1 and 2 (in addition to NOAA
satellites).

    11) Update "Descriptive Information" for single dump mnemonic "prflrh".

  BENEFIT:
    Changes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 are being made to account for data types currently
(or about to be) in the production databases.
    Change 7 is being made because tank type 012, subtype 003 is being replaced
 with tank type 012, subtype 004.
    Changes 8 and 9 are being made such that METOP-1 (B) is identified as a
satellite contributing to the applicable dump types in the Real-Time Data
Monitoring System web page.
    Change 10 is being made such that METOP-1 (B) and METOP-2 (A) are
identified as satellites contributing to the applicable dump types in the
Real-Time Data Monitoring System web page.

   network, if that network executes this version of
   obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.)


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   There are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.  All jobs executing this
   version of obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist should be tested.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   See information about dissemination in the latest release notes for
   obsproc_<NETWORK> packages which execute this version of
   obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This should be implemented on BOTH WCOSS Phase 1 and WCOSS Phase 2 (has
   Steven's approval).  The implementation needs to be made on Phase 1 because
   dumpjb in obsproc_dump (which is not part of this bundle) is hardwrired  to
   look for bufr_dumplist in /nwprod if only the version number is provided
   (this is for wrapper scripts running dumpjb outside the normal
   obsproc_<network> in production).  We will modify dumpjb in the next release
   of obsproc_dump to determine the location of bufr_dumplist (/nwprod vs.
   /nwprod2) based on the version number the wrapper script provides to it (if
   that, indeed, is what the wrapper script is providing to point to the
   bufr_dumplist file - never the case in production).  Once that update to
   dumpjb in obsproc_dump is implemented, this latest version of bufr_dumplist
   can be removed from Phase 1.

   This is part of OBSPROC.v6.4.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of:
      v2.1.0 of obsproc_cdas,
      v2.0.0 of obsproc_dump_monitor,
      v2.2.0 of obsproc_dump_post,
      v2.3.0 of obsproc_global,
      v2.2.0 of obsproc_nam,
      v3.7.0 of obsproc_prep,
      v2.3.0 of obsproc_prep_post,
      v2.2.0 of obsproc_rap;
   but AFTER the implementation of v3.1.0 of obsproc_satingest.

   Since there are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist, an
   obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist.ver file is not needed.

obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist release 1.2.0 --> released May 1, 2015
                                           --> implemented Aug 10, 2015

files:
 M obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist/fix/bufr_dumplist
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 Fixed file changes:

     1) Add the following new single dump mnemonics for future tank types:
"infvr" [VIIRS (NPP) infrared derived cloud motion, type 005, subtype 090],
"efclam" [GOES imager effective cloud amount data (University of Wisconsin),
type 012, subtype 160].
     2) Add BUFR type 005, subtypes 019, 080, and 090 to dump group mnemonic
"satwnd".
     3) Add BUFR type 005, subtype 090 to dump group mnemonics "sluas" and
"005".
     4) Add BUFR type 012, subtype 160 to dump group mnemonics "sfsat" and
"012".
  BENEFIT:
    The "satwnd" dumps will now, by default, include BUFR type 005, subtypes
 019 (GOES/NESDIS 3.9 micron channel derived cloud motion), 080 [AVHRR (NOAA/
METOP) infrared derived cloud motion], and 090 [VIIRS (NPP) infrared derived
cloud motion - VIIRS may not yet be in production database].  These will be
tested in various GSI upgrades in the next quarter.
    The "efclam" dumps will eventually be read by the RTMA/URMA GSI, replacing
the BUFR files output to /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/wtxtbul which are now used
by the "about-to-be-implemented" RTMA/URMA GSI upgrade. Those files are created
in satingest job JIGOES_CLOUD and are just a 1:1 translation of each input file
to BUFR.

     5) Change the following single dump mnemonics from moderately-critical to
non-critical: "trmm" (BUFR type 012, subtype 013) in the GFS, GDAS and HOURLY
networks; "1bhrs3" (BUFR type 021, subtype 025) in the HOURLY and RAP networks.

from critical to non-critical in the RAP network

    14) Single dump mnemonic "prflre" (European profiler winds, BUFR type 002,
subtype 016) changed from typo "proflre".

    15) All references to "RUC" changed to "RAP".

  BENEFIT:
    Changes 1, 3, 6, 8 (partial) and 9 are all being made to account for data
types currently in the production databases.  OSCAT is now being dumped in
the NAM, NDAS, GFS and GDAS networks.  The other types will be dumped soon in
production.
    Change 10 is being made so that the "vadwnd" dumps in the DUMP_MONITOR,
NAM and NDAS networks (only for now) will now include BUFR type 002 subtype 017
(VAD winds coming out of Level 2 decoder).  These are being tested in the
parallel NAM/NDAS in preparation for their operational use in the upcoming
FY14Q2 NAM bundle.  The RTDM will now include dump count graphics for these
(under mnemonic "nxrdw2").
    Changes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 (partial) are all being made to account for data
types currently in the developmental databases.  These will become operational
when they are promoted to /dcom.
    Changes 11-13 account for changes in the various network's usage of these
data types and brings the dump alert system and RTDM system up to date since
the last time the dumplist was updated.  Some types that were previously
assimilated operationally in some networks are no longer assimilated.  Other
types that were previously not assimilated in some networks are now
assimilated operationally.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Changes 1-9 have no affect on operations.  Users dumping future data types
from the developmental and checkout BUFR databases will now have dump
mnemonics.
   Changes 10-12 will enhance the RTDM and dump alert system since the warnings
here will now be better tuned to the actual criticality of the data w.r.t.
NCEP analyses. 


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   No changes.


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   There are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.  All jobs executing this
   version of obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist will be part of the parallel-
   production test of the hourly GOES satellite winds.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   See information about dissemination in the latest release notes for
   obsproc_<NETWORK> packages which execute obsproc_dump which in turn executes
   this version of obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v1.0.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of
   obsproc_dump.v3.0.0, obsproc_dump_monitor.v1.0.0, obsproc_global.v1.0.0,
   obsproc_nam.v1.0.0, obsproc_rap.v1.0.0, obsproc_rtma.v1.1.0,
   obsproc_urma.v1.1.0, obsproc_satingest.v2.0.0 and
   obsproc_shared/bufr_cword.v1.0.0.

   It should be implemented PRIOR to NESDIS' promotion of their hourly GOES
   satellite winds to their production server,

   Since there are no jobs in obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist, an
   obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist.ver file is not needed.
