 M obsproc_prep_post/ush/gdas_summary.sh

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 Model script changes:
   exprep_post.sh.ecf:
    - Removed call of ush/gdascounts_archive_pyear.sh.  This script had been
      invoked every Feb 2nd to move monthly subdirectories with content for
      the previous year from the main satcounts directory to a new YYYY
      subdirectory of satcounts_archive.  This logic became obsolete with the
      move of satcounts files to YYYYMM subdirectories in July 2017.
    - For "rtma_ru" runs, indicated by the existence of imported variable
      "cycM", adjusts joblog messages and stdout echo messages to include
      minutes, or fraction of hour where applicable, in cycle time and change
      run from RTMA to RTMA_RU.

 USH script changes:
   gdas_summary.sh:
    - Removed option to input satcounts data from older MON directories
      (eg, satcounts/APR or satcounts_archive/2016/APR).
    - Removed unnecessary set of variable "month"

   gdascounts_archive_pyear.sh:
    - Deleted.  No longer needed.

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 Model script changes:
   exprep_post.sh.ecf:
    - Replaced hardwired filename prefix "gdas1" with imported variable "$RUN"
      in preparation for gdas filename change (gdas1->gdas).  The dbnet alerts
      for gdas runs will also be based on $RUN (translated to upper case).
    - Updated pointer to timetwin software which has been imported from
      /nwprod/util/sorc into this package.
    - Added FORT_BUFFERED=TRUE when calling timetwin executable to improve
      performance when running on Cray-XC40.
    - Corrected the invocation of prep_step prior to the call of timetwin.
    - Added wrapper to skip yearly invocation of gdascounts_archive_pyear.sh if
      SATCOMIN is on /gpfs/hps.  (See changes to gdas_summary.sh below.)
    - Removed default settings for USHobsproc_prep_post, FIXobsproc_prep_post,
      and EXECobsproc_prep_post.  These are now defined in all recent versions
      of the only job script that needs them (obsproc_global/JGDAS_PREP_POST).
    - Added variable "$PROCESS_UNBLKBUFR" to control whether or not to attempt
      to create and alert an "unblok" copy of an unrestricted prepbufr file.
      The default setting is "YES", however, as before, no such copy is made
      if there is no "unblok" version of the original restricted prepbufr file.
    - Added /bin/sh shebang.
      
 USH script changes:
   gdas_counts.sh:
    - Replaced hardwired filename prefix "gdas1" with imported variable "$RUN"
      in preparation for gdas filename change (gdas1->gdas).
   gdas_countstat.sh:
    - Replaced hardwired filename prefix "gdas1" with new variable "$run" in
      preparation for gdas filename change (gdas1->gdas). "$run" will typically
      be set to "$RUN" in production runs, but using the lowercase variable here
      (and adding optional argument described below) for consistency with the
      original version of this script.
    - Added optional 6th argument to pass in a value for $run (to aid generation
      of statistics in delayed mode).
    - Removed unnecessary commands and pared down local copies of dump status
      files that are repeatedly grep'd to improve performance on Cray-XC40.
    - Use sed instead of cut command to extract count values from dump status
      files in order to properly parse count info if the field width changes.
    - Added /bin/sh shebang.
   gdas_summary.sh:
    - Added logic to use new naming convention satcounts.YYYYMM to archive
      satellite count files instead of satcounts/MMM.  (With this change, the
      monthly directories don't need to be moved to a separate archive directory
      each year and it is easier for NCO to age off old directories if needed).
      Temporary logic is included to continue use of the MMM subdirectories
      (eg: JAN, FEB, etc) until the SATCOMIN directory moves to /gpfs/hps.
    - Use local arrays to store month names in various styles instead of 
      calling util_shared script month_name.sh.  (This eliminates the need
      to load the util_shared module for jgdas_prep_post).
    - Removed leading "sh" when invoking gdas_countstat.sh. (safety measure in
      case the latter is changed to another style script in the future)
    - Corrected the invocation of prep_step prior to the call of gdascounts_ave.
    - Added /bin/sh shebang.
   global_postevents.sh:
    - Updated to run on Cray-XC40 (as well as IBM iDataPlex).
      - Environment variable $SITE or getsystem.pl are used to determine if
        running on Cray-XC40.
      - If running on Cray-XC40, use aprun to invoke the global_postevents
        executable.
    - Changed exit values of 555 (which is out of the acceptable range) to 55
      to ensure that the parent script sees the intended value.
    - (Note that this script is not known to be currently used in production)

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - Added logic to build on Cray-XC40 such that no change is necessary in
      the makefiles. (FC exported from build.sh overrides setting in makefiles).
    - Upgrade from ics/12.1 to ics/16.0.3 for builds on IBM iDataPlex.
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Modified to handle library module patterns used on WCOSS IBM and Cray.
    - Added nemsio version number (2.2.2) and module load.
    - Upgraded w3emc version from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0.
    - Upgraded bacio version from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2.
    - Upgraded sigio version from 1.0.1 to 2.0.1.
    - Added special variable to allow for different versions of sigio or nemsio
      on Cray vs IBM if needed.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Modified to handle library pathnames used on WCOSS IBM and Cray-XC40.
      (on Cray-XC40, point to libs built with intel compiler)
    - Added nemsio version number (2.2.2) and var NEMSIO_LIB
    - Upgraded w3emc version from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0.
    - Upgraded bacio version from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2.
    - Upgraded sigio version from 1.0.1 to 2.0.1.
    - Added special variables to allow for different versions of sigio or nemsio
      on Cray vs IBM if needed.
    - Added pointers to 8-byte builds of w3emc, w3nco and bufr libraries
      (needed by timetwin.fd).
   README.build in sorc directory:
    - Reorganized and removed instructions for compiling without build.sh.
   timetwin.fd (timetwin.f and makefile):
    - New.  Copied from /nwprod/util/sorc and modified as follows:
       - timetwin.f: (No changes)
       - makefile: Use environment variables to point to libraries (with 
         versions set by load_libs.rc or setlibs.rc).  Added install target,
         debug options and documentation plus minor cleanup.
   global_postevents.fd (makefile):
    - Added variable $NEMSIO_LIB to library list in order to successfully build
      with the new version of the w3emc library and process nemsio global
      analysis files.

      BUFR messages for which all reports are considered restricted and will be
      removed.
      BENEFIT: All U.S.-provided (ENI) reports in message type "GPSIPW" are
               restricted (although currently not denoted as such) and,if
               present, are stripped out of the non-restricted PREPBUFR file.
               Foreign-provided (GNSS) reports in message type "GPSIPW" are non-
               restricted, but they are currently not encoded into the
               restricted PREPBUFR files.  If they were, they too would be
               (incorrectly) stripped out of the non-resticted PREPBUFR file.
               Currently the interface subroutine to the "gpsipw" dump file (in
               prepobs_prepdata) does not pass any restriction information over,
               so all reports coming from the "gpsipw" dump file must be
               considered as restricted.  Once this is corrected (and U.S.-
               provided reports are denoted as restricted), "GPSIPW" will be
               moved to the list of PREPBUFR Table A entries which contain a
               mixture of restricted and non-rstricted reports.  This will have
               no affect until non-restricted foreign-provided (GNSS) reports
               are allowed to be encoded into the PREPBUFR files.

 USH script changes:
   gdascounts_archive_pyear.sh:
    - Split imported script variable $ARCHCOM into separate input and output
      variables $ARCHCOMIN and $ARCHCOMOUT set in parent Job Script. If
      $ARCHCOMIN .ne. $ARCHCOMOUT files will be copied from
      $ARCHCOMIN/satcounts to ARCHCOM/satcounts_archive rather than moved.
      BENEFIT: Allows developer runs to specify a production input location and
               a local output location.
   gdascounts_combine.sh:
    - Split imported script variable $DATCOM1 into separate input and output
      variables $DATCOM1_IN and $DATCOM1_OUT set in parent Job Script.
      BENEFIT: Allows developer runs to specify a production input location and
               a local output location.
   gdas_counts.sh, gdas_countstat.sh, satellite_summary.sh:
    - Split imported script variables $SATCOM and $DATCOM into separate input
      and output variables $SATCOMIN (root to $SATCOMIN_dir) and $SATCOMOUT_dir,
      and $DATCOMIN (root to $DATCOMIN_dir) and $DATCOMOUT_dir set in parent
      Job Script.
      BENEFIT: Allows developer runs to specify a production input location and
               a local output location.
   gdas_summary.sh:
    - Split imported script variables $DATCOM1, $SATCOM and $DATCOM into
      separate input and output variables $DATCOM1_IN and $DATCOM1_OUT,
      $SATCOMIN (root to $SATCOMIN_dir, replacing $SATCOM_monsum_base which had
      been set here) and $SATCOMOUT_dir, and $DATCOMIN (root to $DATCOMIN_dir,
      replacing $DATCOM_monsum_base which had been set here) and $DATCOMOUT_dir
      set in parent Job Script.
      BENEFIT: Allows developer runs to specify a production input location and
               a local output location.
   mstr_shp_stn_lst_update.sh:
    - If input archive directory .ne. output archive directory and there are no
      files in output archive directory, then if no changes to files, copy them
      from input archive directory to output archive directory.
      BENEFIT:  Allows developer runs to populate $VOSarch_OUT even when there
                are no file changes.

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - Increased likelihood of consistent builds by purging currently loaded
      environment modules and loading specific compiler module.  The
      default ibmpe module is then loaded for codes that might need it.
    - Switch from using setlibs.rc to load_libs.rc (which loads library
      modules).
    - If environment variable $clobber is exported to this script with value
      "clobber_no", then the "make clobber" step is skipped. If $clobber not
      imported, "make clobber" will proceed as before.
      BENEFIT: This may be useful if one is debugging only one source code
               within a program with multiple source codes.
   README.build in sorc directory:
    - Updated to reflect changes in build.sh (see above).
    - Added information on cleaning directories (was inadvetently omitted).
    - Corrected some typos.
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the bufrlib version from v11.0.1 to v11.1.0.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the bufrlib version from v11.0.1 to v11.1.0.

 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v6.4.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of:
      v2.1.0 of obsproc_cdas,
      v2.0.0 of obsproc_dump_monitor,
      v2.2.0 of obsproc_dump_post,

obsproc_prep_post release 2.2.0 --> released Feb 23, 2016
                                --> implemented May 11, 2016

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 Model script changes:
   exprep_post.sh.ecf:
    - Use NCO-established variables (presumably obtained from modules) to point
      to prod utilities:
       - $NDATE from module prod_util (default or specified version, loaded in
         each network which executes this script in this version of
         obsproc_prep_post) which replaces executable ndate in non-versioned,
         horizontal structure utility directory path defined by imported
         variable $utilexec.
    - Added variable PROCESS_MASTER_SHIP_STNLST which, when YES, updates the
      Master Ship Station List based on any information read from the updated
      VOS ship list from NDBC.
      BENEFIT: Job JRW1 uses an updated Master Ship Station List to generate
               marine monthly statistics when it runs at 12z on the first day
               of the month.

 USH script changes:
   gdascounts_archive_pyear.sh:
    - Minor updates to script docblock.
   gdas_countstat.sh:
    - Use NCO-established variables (presumably obtained from modules) to point
      to prod utilities:
       - ush finddate.sh where prepended-path $PATH from module prod_util
         (default or specified version, loaded in each network which executes
         this script in this version of obsproc_prep_post) replaces horizontal
         structure utility directory path defined by imported variable
         $utilscript.  Echo full path to finddate.sh to stdout.
   gdas_summary.sh:
    - Use NCO-established variables to point to root directories for main
      software components and input/output directories in order to run on WCOSS
      Phase 1 or Phase 2:
       - $COMROOT which replaces hardwire to "/com".
    - Use NCO-established variables (presumably obtained from modules) to point
      to prod utilities:
       - ush finddate.sh where prepended-path $PATH from module prod_util
         (default or specified version, loaded in each network which executes
         this script in this version of obsproc_prep_post) replaces horizontal
         structure utility directory path defined by imported variable
         $utilscript.  Echo full path to finddate.sh to stdout.
       - ush month_name.sh where prepended-path $PATH from module
         util_shared/v1.0.2 (currently only specified version, loaded in each
         network which executes this script in this version of
         obsproc_prep_post) replaces horizontal structure utility directory
         path defined by imported variable $utilscript]. Echo full path to
         month_name.sh to stdout.
   mstr_shp_stn_lst_update.sh:
    - New.  Copies an updated VOS ship list from NDBC and merges the file with
      a copy of the previous ship_names list.
   mstr_shp_stn_lst_update2.sh
    - New.  Updates the "Master Ship Station List" file and the (modified) NDBC
      active ship list file and copies them both into the archive so they will
      be ready for tomorrow's run.

 Source code changes:
   load_libs.rc and setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the bufrlib version from v10.2.5 to v11.0.1.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Point to /nwprod2 copy of all libs managed by NCO except for sigio.
   (Note: global_postevents hangs in the call to gblevents if compiled with
          /nwprod2 build of sigio.v2.0.1 and the current build of w3emc.v2.2.0.
          The latter was compiled with sigio.v1.0.1.  Thus we will stick with
          /nwprod build of sigio.v1.0.1 for codes that call gblevents until
          w3emc lib is updated to use the newer sigio lib, or gblevents is
          moved to another library, or such.)

   obsproc_prep_post should be tested.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   See information about dissemination in the latest release notes for
   obsproc_<NETWORK> packages which execute this version of obsproc_prep_post.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v6.1.0.
   It is expected that this will be implemented simultaneously with the
   implementation of the FY16Q3 GFS Upgrade bundle on Phase 2.  However, it
   could go in sooner.  Please note, however, that this must be implemented
   simultaneously with the implementation of obsproc_global v2.2.0 on either
   Phase 1 or Phase 2.
   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   IMPORTANT 1:  It is expected that at some point PRIOR to this
                 implementation, Dataflow has promoted the transfer of the
                 current day's active ship list from NDBC (file activeShipLst)
                 from /dcomdev/us007003/ndbc/ to /dcom/us007003/ndbc/ .
   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   IMPORTANT 2:  In addition, at the same time the utility scripts
                   /nwprod/util/ush/marine_genstats_akiss.sh  and
                   /nwprod/util/ush/marine_genstats_allstx.sh
               which are executed inside /nwprod/jobs/JRW1 at 12z on the first
               day of each month (to generate, in part, monthly ship statistics
               over the Gulf of AK and elsewhere, resp.) must be changed such
               that program /nwprod/util/exec/marine_stats_newstats (which
               reads the ship names and its monthly old stat file in order to
               generate the new monthly marine statistics for OPC)
               reads in the new, daily-updated, Master Ship Station List
               generated via the changes in obsproc_prep_post v2.2.0.
               Specifically:
                 In /nwprod/util/ush/marine_genstats_akiss.sh, change line 57
                 from:
                   export FORT11="$FIXhrly/ship_names"
                 to
                   export FORT11="${VOSarch_IN:-/com2/arch/prod/VOS}/ship_names
                 and in /nwprod/util/ush/marine_genstats_allstx.sh, change line
                 55 from:
                   export FORT11="$FIXhrly/ship_names"
                 to
                   export FORT11="${VOSarch_IN:-/com2/arch/prod/VOS}/ship_names
               Note that this change to JRW1 is considered as a downstream
               change to the GFS upgrade and thus avoids the EE requirement for
               its update.

 Model script changes:
   exprep_post.sh.ecf:
    - Removed SENDWEB wrapper around call to gdas_summary.sh so that stats can
      be computed even if the info won't be posted to the web.
    - Updated pointers to software that has been imported from /nwprod/util
      into this package and removed hardwired pointers to the common utils.
    - Fail immediately if can't find gdas nor gfs prepbufr file for current
      cycle required to check for TimeTwins.
    - Set new required variables that may not be passed in from older J-scripts.

       - Added option to send html updates to developer web space for developer
         runs.
   gdas_countstat.sh:
    - New.  Copied from /nwprod/util/ush and modified as follows:

    - New.  Copied from /nwprod/util/ush and modified as follows:
       - Updated pointers to other software likewise imported from /nwprod/util.
       - Updated the parsing of cosmic/gps info in order to post those counts
         properly in the stats table.  (The old logic was obsolete following the
         May 2012 GFS/GDAS upgrade).
       - Made additional minor changes to reduce unnecessary warnings.
   gdascounts_combine.sh:
    - New.  Copied from /nwprod/util/ush and modified as follows:

       - makefile: Added install target and debug options plus minor cleanup.
                   Added documentation similar to that in other obsproc managed
                   makefiles. 

 Fixed file changes:

    - remove "module use -a /nwprod/lib/modulefiles" and
             "module avail"
      BENEFIT: No longer needed and can slow down compilation.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   No changes. (PROCESS_SATELLITE_COUNTS was previously set to NO in all
   applicable network PREP_POST jobs.)


 Shared Software:
 ----------------
    - Source code global_postevents:
         links to version 2.0.6 of w3nco library
         links to version 10.2.5 of bufr library
         links to version 2.2.0 of w3emc library
         links to version 2.0.1 of bacio library
         links to version 2.0.2 of sp library (previously version 2.0.1)
         links to version 1.0.1 of sigio library


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   There are no jobs in obsproc_prep_post.  All jobs executing this version of
   obsproc_prep_post will be part of the parallel-production test of the
   OBSPROC FY14Q4 bundle.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   See information about dissemination in the latest release notes for
   obsproc_<NETWORK> packages which execute this version of obsproc_prep_post.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v4.0.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of:
      v1.2.1 of obsproc_dump_monitor,
      v2.0.2 of obsproc_global, obsproc_nam, obsproc_rap, obsproc_rtma,
      v2.0.2 of obsproc_urma,
      v2.3.0 of obsproc_satingest,
      v3.2.0 of obsproc_dump, obsproc_prep,
      v1.0.0 of obsproc_dump_alert, radar_reflectivity_mosaic,
      v1.0.0 of radar_reflectivity_ref2grb,
      v1.0.1 of obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.

   Since there are no jobs in obsproc_prep_post, an obsproc_prep_post.ver file
   is not needed.

   Remove /nwprod/ush/global_satcount.sh from production.

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 Model script changes:
   exprep_post.sh.ecf:
    - Environment variable $REMX (complete path to bufr_remorest executable)
      no longer defaults to /nwprod/exec/bufr_remorest but rather to
      $EXECobsproc_shared_bufr_remorest/bufr_remorest as bufr_remorest package
      has been populated into vertical structure.
    - Modified to change path to ush bufr_remorest.sh from $ushscript_remorest
      to $USHobsproc_shared_bufr_remorest as bufr_remorest package has been
      populated into vertical structure.

 USH script changes:
   global_postevents.sh:
    - No changes (other than move to vertical structure).

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to build executable global_postevents in the
      global_postevents.fd sub-directory of the sorc directory.  Reads either
      load_libs.rc or setlibs.rc file to point to library version numbers
      needed by makefile.
   clean.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to "make clean" global_postevents.fd sub-directory in the sorc
      directory (generally after a build).
   install.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to install (move) executable global_postevents (after build) in
      exec directory (assumed to be in same root directory as sorc).
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefile.  (Not read if setlibs.rc is read.)
   README.build in sorc directory:
    - New. Documentation on using build.sh, install.sh and clean.sh.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefile.  (Not read if load_libs.rc is read.)
   global_postevents:
      gblevents (in w3emc library - version 2.2.0):
       - The changes in gblevents are not applicable to global_postevents
         because it runs in the "POSTEVENTS" mode.
      gblevents:
       - No change to source.
    - Makefile modified to use environment variables to point to library
      version numbers and to add sample build script and info in sorc
      directory.  This generalizes the library version information.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   No changes.

   obsproc_prep_post will be part of the parallel-production test of the
   OBSPROC Phase 2 bundle.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   See information about dissemination in the latest release notes for
   obsproc_<NETWORK> packages which execute this version of obsproc_prep_post.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v3.0.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of
   obsproc_dump_monitor.v1.2.0, obsproc_global.v2.0.0, obsproc_nam.v2.0.0,
   obsproc_rap.v2.0.0, obsproc_rtma.v2.0.0, obsproc_urma.v2.0.0,
   obsproc_dump.v3.1.0, obsproc_dump_post.v2.0.0, obsproc_prep.v3.0.0,
   obsproc_satingest.v2.2.0, obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest.v1.0.0 and
   obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.v1.0.0.

   This must also be implemented simultaneously with or immediately after the
   w3emc_v2.2.0 implementation.

   Since there are no jobs in obsproc_prep_post, an obsproc_prep_post.ver file
   is not needed.
