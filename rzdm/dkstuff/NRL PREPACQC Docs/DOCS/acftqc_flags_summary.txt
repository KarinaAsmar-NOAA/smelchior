[1] If altitude is read and pressure computed, c_qc(ii)(5:5) = 'R'
    If pressure is read and altitude computed, c_qc(ii)(5:5) = 'r'


call_acftqc_tfile_all.f
-----------------------

1)   The QC flag array (c_qc) is initialized as '-----------'.  A dash therefore
     indicates that that particular variable was not checked.

2)   Most aircraft data either gives pressure or (pressure) altitude.  Only MDCRS
     lists both.  Therefore, c_qc(ii)(5:5) is set to signal which was computed from
     the other.

     c_qc(ii)(5:5) = 'r'    if pressure is read and altitude computed (NAVDAS = -6)

     c_qc(ii)(5:5) = 'R'    if altitude is read and pressure computed (NAVDAS = -8)

     These flags are informational only and do not indicate that the report was rejected.


3)   If odd values of various parameters are detected in reading the MDCRS data,
     the report is flagged as bad in column 1.  (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 28)

     c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'B'    if a non-alphanumeric character is found
                                 in the flight id or tail number.

                            if the temperature precision is other than 100, 50,
                                 25, 10, or -99.

                            if the data relay system is other than 3.

                            if the position QC is other than 0.

                            if the flight phase is other than 3, 5, 6, or 9.
                                (7 added to account for an ISIS2000 problem--1/26/00)

                            if the wind instrument is other than 4.
				(0, 8, or 12 are also valid, but I haven't seen any examples.)

                            if the roll angle QC flag is other than 0, 1, or 9.
                                 (3 added to account for an ISIS2000 problem--1/26/00)

                            if the mixing ratio QC flag is other than 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
                                 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or -9.

                            if the ACARS interpolation flag is other than 0, 2, 3,
                                 or 9. (1 is also valid, but I haven't seen any examples.)

     This flag indicates that the report should be rejected.  However, the decoder
     problem that this flag addresses has been fixed; no decoder problems were 
     found in the October 1998 dataset.  Even so, new problems can occur; a problem in
     the data stream caused this problem to reappear in the April 1999 dataset.  Note 
     that some of the variables are assigned a single character in the FGGE format; in 
     this case, 9 implies a missing value.  It should also be noted that acceptable
     values can also change.  The changes to the MDCRS data stream in November 2000
     included the addition of FedEx reports, which have a temperature precision of
     0.1K.  Both the data and the decoder should be examined if decoder errors show up!


acftobs_qc.f
------------

1)   Duplicate check (dupchek_qc)

     This subroutine checks for both near and exact duplicates.  An effort is 
     made to retain the better of the two reports when a duplicate is found.

     a)   c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'N'     if the report cannot be checked for duplicates
                                       (This happens only for the first report.)
                                       (don't reject) (NAVDAS = 0)

     b)   c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'D'     if report is an exact duplicate (REJECT REPORT!)
	                               (NAVDAS = 20)

     c)   c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'd'     if report is a near duplicate.  An effort is made to
	                          keep the better of the two reports, e.g., MDCRS 
				  is kept over AIREP, AMDAR is kept over AIREP, 
				  AIREP is kept over manAIREP, full ids are kept
				  over truncated ids, reports with temperature or
			    	  winds missing are rejected if the duplicate has
				  temperature/winds, MDCRS reports with the roll 
			          angle QC flag marked bad are rejected, etc.
			          (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 22)

     d)   c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'e'     if report is a close duplicate with the same aircraft 
	                          id in which the temperatures differ by a large
			          amount and the winds are missing in the rejected
			          report.  This seems to be some sort of systematic
				  error associated with manual aireps.  The report
				  with the missing winds is generally the one with 
				  the bad temperature. (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 24)

     e)   c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'E'     if an encode error is detected, that is the report is 
	                          a close duplicate with the same aircraft id in
	                          which either the temperatures differ by more than
				  2.05K or the winds differ by more than 1.25 m/s
				  or 10 deg.  (Close duplicates with the same 
				  aircraft id and with temperature differences less
			          than 2.05K are marked as near duplicates.)
				  (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 24)

          c_qc(ii)(6:6) = 'E'     if a temperature encode error is detected, one report
		                  is rejected (c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'E') and the other
				  report has the temperature marked bad with 'E'
				  (reject temperature only!) (NAVDAS = 26)

          c_qc(ii)(7:7) = 'E'     if a wind direction encode error is detected, one
	                          report is rejected (c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'E') and the
				  other report has the wind direction marked bad
				  with 'E' (reject wind only!) (NAVDAS = 26)

          c_qc(ii)(8:8) = 'E'     if a wind speed encode error is detected, one report
		                  is rejected (c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'E') and the other
				  report has the wind speed marked bad with 'E'
				  (reject wind only!) (NAVDAS = 26)

     f)   c_qc(ii)(1:1) = ' '     if report is good and is retained in duplicate check
	                          (NAVDAS = 0)


2)   Invalid report check (invalid_qc)

     The invalid report check looks for obviously invalid reports and rejects them.

     a)   c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'B'     if the aircraft id equals 'XX999' (REJECT REPORT!)
	                          (This normally occurs only for manual aireps
				  and indicates the flight id was missing.)
				  (NAVDAS = 28)

     b)   c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'B'     if the report was marked bad in the decoder
				  (REJECT REPORT!) (details are shown above)
				  (NAVDAS = 28)

     c)   c_qc(ii)(3:4) = 'BB'    if the latitude and longitude are both zero 
	                          (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 62)

     d)   c_qc(ii)(2:2) = 'M'     if time is missing (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 50)

     e)   c_qc(ii)(3:3) = 'M'     if latitude is missing (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 52)

     f)   c_qc(ii)(4:4) = 'M'     if longitude is missing (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 52)

     g)   c_qc(ii)(5:5) = 'M'     if both pressure and altitude are missing 
	                          (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 54)

     h)   c_qc(ii)(5:5) = 'B'     if pressure is too small (< 116 mb) or altitude
                                  is too high (> or = 50,000') (AFR and BAW
				  manAIREPs above 50,000' are valid and allowed) 
				  (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 64)

     i)   c_qc(ii)(5:5) = 'B'     if the pressure altitude is small (< 600 ft) and
	                          the report is an airep or man_airep (The 
				  AIREP format does not allow negatives, so
				  AMDAR reports with negative altitudes are
				  re-encoded as AIREPs with a positive altitude!)
				  (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 64)

     j)   c_qc(ii)(6:8) = 'MMM'   if the report is "empty"-- temperature and winds 
                                  are either missing or zero (REJECT REPORT!)
				  (NAVDAS = 56)
									   
          c_qc(ii)(9:9) = 'N'     if report is "empty" and moisture is not missing
		                  (NAVDAS = -1)

	  c_qc(ii)(9:9) = 'M'     if report is "empty" and moisture is missing
		                  (NAVDAS = 56)

     k)   c_qc(ii)(6:6) = 'I'     if the temperature equals -9C and would be rejected
	                          by the gross check or three consecutive reports
				  from the same flight have a temperature of -9C
				  (two in a row at the beginning or end of a flight)
				  (reject temperature only) (NAVDAS = 47)


3)   Stuck check (stk_val_qc)

     This subroutine looks for flights (or portions of flights in some cases) where
     the time, latitude, longitude, pressure, temperature, or winds are constant (or
     nearly so).  The constant time check is performed on flights with three or more 
     reports; the remaining checks are performed on flights with four or more reports.
     There is also a requirement that the flight consist either of all manAIREPs or
     more than three automated reports.

     a)   c_qc(ii)(2:2) = 'K'     if time is constant within 1 second for the whole 
                                  flight (or a portion of the flight with three 
    	    	                  or more constant time reports) and either 
				  1) time equals zero; 2) altitudes vary less 
				  than 100 ft; or 3) altitudes vary more than 
				  9000 ft (to permit constant time for the bottom 
				  of a high-resolution sounding). (REJECT REPORT!)
				  (NAVDAS = 40)

     b)   c_qc(ii)(3:4) = 'KK'    if latitude and longitude are both constant within
	                          0.015 deg for the whole flight (or for a portion 
				  of the flight with three or more constant 
				  position reports and either 1) lat is constant 
				  at 0; 2) lon is constant at 0; 3) altitudes vary
				  less than 100 ft; or 4) altitudes vary more than 
				  9000 ft. (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 42)

     c)   c_qc(ii)(3:3) = 'K'     if latitude is constant within 0.005 deg for the 
	                          whole flight (but the latitude is not rounded 
	                          to the nearest whole degree), the flight
				  lasts more than 30 min, and either 1) the 
				  latitude equals zero; 2) altitudes vary less
				  than 100 ft; or 3) altitudes vary more than
				  9000 ft (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 42)

     d)   c_qc(ii)(4:4) = 'K'     if longitude is constant within 0.005 deg for the 
	                          whole flight (but the longitude is not rounded
				  to the nearest whole degree), the flight 
				  lasts more than 30 min, and either 1) the
				  longitude equals zero; 2) altitudes vary less
				  than 100 ft; or 3) altitudes vary more than
                                  9000 ft (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 42)

     e)   c_qc(ii)(5:5) = 'K'     if pressure is constant within 0.05 mb for the
	                          whole flight, the pressure is greater than 
			          750 mb, and the flight lasts more than 30 min
                                  (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 44)

     f)   c_qc(ii)(5:5) = 'K'     if altitude is constant within 10 ft for the whole
	                          flight, the altitude is less than 8000 ft,
				  and the flight lasts more than 30 min
                                  (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 44)

     g)   c_qc(ii)(6:6) = 'K'     if temperature is constant within 0.05K for the 
	                          whole flight and either the altitude varies 
				  by more than 1500 ft or the maximum altitude
				  is greater than 25,000 ft
                                  (REJECT REPORT only if winds are constant as well!
				  Otherwise reject only temperature)  (NAVDAS = 46)
									   
     h)   c_qc(ii)(6:6) = 'R'     if temperature was recomputed to account for 
                                  having been measured in whole degrees C and 
                                  reported as if in tenths (MDCRS or ACARS)
                                  (don't reject temperature--temperature precision 
				  changed to 1.00) (NAVDAS = -10)

     i)   c_qc(ii)(6:6) = 'b'     if temperature was marked bad to account for
                                  having been measured in whole degrees C and 
                                  reported as if in tenths (AIREP)
                                  (reject temperature but not entire report)
				  (NAVDAS = 67)

     j)   c_qc(ii)(7:7) = 'K'     if wind direction constant within 0.5 deg for the 
	                          whole flight (but the direction is not rounded
				  to the nearest ten degrees) and either the
				  altitudes vary less than 100 ft or more than 
				  9000 ft (REJECT REPORT only if temperature is 
				  constant as well!  Otherwise reject only winds)
				  (NAVDAS = 46)
 
     k)   c_qc(ii)(8:8) = 'K'     if wind speed constant within 0.05 m/s for the whole
	                          flight (excluding flights with direction rounded
				  to nearest 10 degrees) and either the altitudes
				  vary less than 100 ft or more than 9000 ft
                                  (REJECT REPORT only if temperature is constant 
				  as well! Otherwise reject only winds) 
				  (NAVDAS = 46)
                                        
     l)   c_qc(ii)(9:9) = 'K'     if mixing ratio constant within 0.005 for the whole
	                          flight, the mixing ratio is greater than zero
				  (zero is assumed to mean missing), and either
				  the altitiudes vary less than 100 ft or more 
				  than 9000 ft (reject only mixing ratio)
				  (NAVDAS = 46)


3)   Gross check (grchek_qc)

     This subroutine compares values to climatological bounds looking for gross errors.

     a)   c_qc(ii)(2:2) = 'S'     if the time is equal to 00Z 
                                  (marked as suspect to be checked later)
				  (NAVDAS = 10)
	 
     b)   c_qc(ii)(2:2) = ' '     if time passes the gross check
                                  (NAVDAS = 0)
	 
     c)   c_qc(ii)(3:3) = 'B'     if the latitude is greater than 90 or less than -90 deg
                                  (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 62)
								  
     d)   c_qc(ii)(3:3) = 'S'     if the latitude is zero 
	                          (marked as suspect to be checked later)
				  (NAVDAS = 12)
	 
     e)   c_qc(ii)(3:3) = ' '     if latitude passes the gross check (NAVDAS = 0)
	 
     f)   c_qc(ii)(4:4) = 'B'     if the longitude is greater than 360 or less than 0 deg
                                  (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 62)
	 
     g)   c_qc(ii)(4:4) = 'S'     if the longitude is zero 
                                  (marked as suspect to be checked later)
				  (NAVDAS = 12)

     h)   c_qc(ii)(4:4) = ' '     if longitude passes the gross check
                                  (NAVDAS = 0)

     i)   c_qc(ii)(5:5) = 'B'     if the pressure is greater than 1080 mb or less than 
                                  50 mb (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 64)

4)   Position check (poschek_qc)

     This subroutine checks duplicate reports with different positions, altitudes
     or times and attempts to choose the best one.  Redundant data at the same
     altitude (at altitudes below 20,000') are also rejected.

     a)  c_qc(ii)(2:2) = 'K'      if the time is stuck for a shorter flight segment
                                  than previously diagnosed (REJECT REPORT!)
				  (NAVDAS = 40)

     b)  c_qc(ii)(5:5) = 'B'	  if the pressure/altitude on the ground is invalid
	                          These reports are from United Airlines, which
				  uses 2000 ft as its lowest report.  They are 
				  detected as being within 5 min of a report
				  at 2000 ft, with a temperature greater than
				  that in the 2000 ft report, and with an altitude
				  difference greater than 6000 ft
	                          (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 64)

     c)  c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'r'      if the report is redundant, diagnosed as multiple
	                          reports on the ground or multiple reports with
				  the same altitude below 8,000', which occurs
				  during descents (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 30)

     d)  A waypoint discrepancy is defined as duplicate manAIREPs with similar times
         and altitudes but with latitudes or longitudes differing by 0.5 deg or more.
	 If the two locations are within 115 km, the positions are averaged together 
	 in the report that is retained.  If reports on either side of the pair are 
	 available and are adequately close (i.e., within 2500 km), a position is 
	 interpolated to the time of the duplicates.  The report closest to the 
	 interpolated position is retained; the other report is rejected.  If only 
	 one neighboring report is available and its time is within 90 minutes of 
	 the duplicate pair, the distances between the neighboring report and each 
	 duplicate is computed.  If one is less than 1500 km and the other is greater 
	 than 1500 km, the nearer one is retained.  If none of these methods is 
	 applicable, both duplicates are rejected.                          
 	 
         c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'W'      if the report is rejected as having a waypoint error
         c_qc(ii)(3:4) = 'BB'          (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 62)

	 c_qc(ii)(3:4) = 'RR'     if an averaged position is used for the report
	                               (do not reject report) (NAVDAS = -4)
								
								
     e)  An altitude discrepancy is defined as duplicate manAIREPs with similar 
	 times, latitudes, and longitudes, but altitudes that differ by more than 
	 1000'.  If reports on either side of the pair are available and are 
	 adequately close, an attempt is made to choose the duplicate that fits 
	 best with those reports.  If neither report fits well enough to be chosen 
	 or if neighboring report(s) are not available, both duplicate reports are 
	 rejected.
								
         c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'A'      if the report is rejected as having an
         c_qc(ii)(5:5) = 'B'           altitude error (NAVDAS = 64)

     f)  A time discrepancy is defined as duplicate manAIREPs with similar latitudes,
	 longitudes, and altitudes, but times that differ by more than 60 sec.  If 
	 the reports are within 30 min, the time is averaged in the report that is 
	 retained.  If reports on either side of the pair are available and are 
	 adequately close, an attempt is made to choose the duplicate that fits 
	 best with those reports.  If neither report fits well enough to be chosen 
	 or if neighboring report(s) are not available, both duplicate reports are 
	 rejected.
								
         c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 't'      if the report is rejected as having an
         c_qc(ii)(2:2) = 'B'           time error (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 60)

	 c_qc(ii)(2:2) = 'R'      if an averaged time is used for the report
		                               (do not reject report) (NAVDAS = -2)

								
5)   Ordering check (ordchek_qc)

     This subroutine first determines whether a particular report is ascending, 
     descending, or in level flight.  If three points close in time are not available, 
     the check is not performed and the report is marked not checked.  Some points are 
     also not easily categorized and so are marked unknown. (Flight phase settings
     affect the instrument type in NAVDAS, not the quality control flag ichk.)

     a)   c_qc(ii)(11:11) = 'A'   if the plane is in high-resolution ascent with 
                                  height, time, and position consistent 
				  (do not reject report)

     b)   c_qc(ii)(11:11) = 'a'   if the plane is in low-resolution ascent with 
	                          height, time, and position consistent
				  (small low-level manuevers allowed) 
				  (do not reject report)

     c)   c_qc(ii)(11:11) = 'L'   if the plane is in level flight with height, time,
	                          and position consistent (do not reject report)

     d)   c_qc(ii)(11:11) = 'D'   if the plane is in high-resolution descent with
	                          height, time, and position consistent 
				  (do not reject report)

     e)   c_qc(ii)(11:11) = 'd'   if the plane is in low-resolution descent with
	                          height, time, and position consistent 
				  (small low-level manuevers allowed) 
				  (do not reject report)

     f)   c_qc(ii)(11:11) = 'I'   if a report (or pair of reports) is isolated in time   
				  (do not reject report)

     g)   c_qc(ii)(11:11) = 'U'   if the flight phase cannot be determined  
				  (do not reject report)

     h)   c_qc(ii)(11:11) = 'N'   if the time difference is too great to permit check
				  (do not reject report)


     The subroutine then looks for inconsistencies in the track of various kinds.

                                  (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 22)

     k)   c_qc(ii)(1:1) = 'p'     if the report is closer to the last rejected point
	  c_qc(ii)(3:4) = 'II'    than to the last accepted point
	                          (REJECT REPORT!) (NAVDAS = 72)

     l)   c_qc(ii)(2:2) = 'I' 	  if the report is a UPS position report 
	                          These reports are performed every 5 min even 
	       		          during high-res ascents and descents.  The time 
				  on the position report is often out-of-sync with 
				  the time on the high-res reports, so these 
				  reports are often out of order.
