MEMORANDUM TO:  Record
FROM:           Dennis A. Keyser -- NP22
Subject:        Changes to IBM-CCS PREPBUFR processing


     Effective 02/24/2009 1200 UTC, the GFS and GDAS GSI analyses no longer
honor the decisions made by the multi-variate quality control program
PREPOBS_OIQCBUFR.  Instead, the GFS/GDAS GSI now runs its own internal
variational quality control on the observations.  PREPOBS_OIQCBUFR continues
to run in the GFS and GDAS networks because other programs still make use of
its output.  The CDAS analysis still honors the output from PREPOBS_OIQCBUFR.
