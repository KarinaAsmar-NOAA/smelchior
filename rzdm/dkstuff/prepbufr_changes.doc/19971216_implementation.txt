MEMORANDUM TO:  Record
FROM:           Dennis A. Keyser -- W/NMC22
Subject:        Changes to 3DVAR/OI/SSI-Data Preprocessor
                (May 1, 1997 Version --
                 EDS, MSO, R3DV DATACARD UPDATE # 7.1)

Implemented 12Z 16 December 1997:

REGIONAL versions ONLY.

********** EDS, MSO, R3DV DATACARD U P D A T E   # 7.1 **********
(IMPLEMENTED 12Z 16 December 1997)

REGIONAL versions ONLY.


I. OPERATIONAL CHANGES

A. CHANGES IN THE PROCESSING OF SATELLITE WIND DATA

     1) The NESDIS low-density 6-hourly cloud-drift satwinds are
replaced with the high-density 3-hourly IR cloud drift winds.
Picture triplet winds are still processed.  For the R3DV version,
water vapor imager cloud-top winds are also assimilated. 


B. CHANGES IN THE PROCESSING OF SURFACE LAND DATA

	1) MSO only: The time window is reduced from +/- 3-hours
about cycle time to +/- 1.5-hours (it was already that way in the
EDS). 


C. GENERAL CHANGES

	1) MSO only: Only data in the lat/lon box 5N to 71.5N and
165W to 26.5W is processed (before the entire N.H. was processed).
