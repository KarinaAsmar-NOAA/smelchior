                 DATACARD UPDATE # 11.0 - NETWORK: RAP)

The September 9, 2004 data preprocessor program (PREPDATA) was updated for the

*************** I B M - C C S   U P D A T E   # 11 **************


I. GENERAL CHANGES

     1) All references to "RUC" (Rapid Update Cycle) are replaced with "RAP"
(Rapid Refresh).  NCEP model run marker (IRNMRK) 4 now refers to "RAP"
network.

     2) The "rap" parm cards (prepobs_prepdata.rap.parm) replace the previous
"ruc" parm cards (prepobs_prepdata.ruc.parm) as update # 11.0).  They are
identical to the ruc" parm cards except for these changes:
          a) turn on the processing of both WindSat and ASCAT scatterometer
             data, both processed with a default time window of +/- 3.00 hours
             about center time (but constrained by their dump time window to
             +/- 2.00 hours about center time for full cycle runs and +/- 0.50
             hours about center time for partial cycle runs)
          b) no longer flag MDCRS-ACARS or TAMDAR aircraft moisture data.
             These will be available to the RAP-GSI,
