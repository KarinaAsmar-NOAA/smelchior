MEMORANDUM TO:  Record
FROM:           Dennis A. Keyser -- NP22
Subject:        Changes to IBM-SP Data Preprocessor (PREPDATA)
                (February 17, 2000 Version -- UPDATE # 3)

The February 17, 2000 data preprocessor program (PREPDATA) was
updated for the third time.  UPDATE#3 was implemented on the IBM-
SP machine at 12Z on January 9, 2001.  Except where noted, the
changes below affect all five versions: ETA, AVN, FNL, RUC and
CDAS.

**************** I B M - S P   U P D A T E   # 3  ***************

I.  GENERAL CHANGES

     1) Removed namelist switch MSGPSF and all logic associated
with it.  For reports in the LFM region if thinning is turned on,
otherwise for all reports, if MSGPSF is TRUE surface land reports
with missing station pressure and missing sea-level pressure are
processed in one of two methods (see a. and b. below).  [MAIN,
SFCDTA, PARM CARDS]
          a. If the reported altimeter setting was non-missing, stored sea-
level pressure as altimeter setting and calculated station pressure as with
reports that only reported sea-level pressure (report types 183, 284 - placed
a "$A" in characters 6 and 7 of station id to identify them).  The altimeter
setting was encoded into the PREPBUFR file.
          b. If the reported altimeter setting was also missing, stored sea-
level pressure as missing and calculated station pressure based on a sea-level
pressure of 1013.3 mb as with reports that only reported a sea-level pressure
(report types 183, 284 - placed a "$S" in characters 6 and 7 of station id to
identify them).
          c. The only versions that set MSGPSF to TRUE were ETA and RUC. 
The ETA did not use these reports (the R3DVAR program skipped over those
reports with the special characters in the station id).  The RUC used the
reported altimeter setting directly, not the calculated station pressure.
          d. The SSI program had not been using any METAR data except where
the PMSL was reported and where the elev was < 7.5 meters (only ~3% of all
METAR reports; these were assigned report type 181 with only pressure and
specific humidity assimilated).  This is because the SSI does not assimilate
data with report type 183 (just as it does not assimilate data with report
types 281 or 284).  The R3DVAR had not been using any METAR data except where
PMSL was reported (~35% of all METAR reports; these were assigned as follows:
report type 181 with pressure, temperature and specific humidity assimilated;
report type 183 with temperature and specific humidity assimilated; and report
types 281 or 284 with wind assimilated).  As noted above, the RUC had been
using the METAR data with reported altimeter setting (and itself generating a
PSTN from it; assigned report types 181, 183, 281 or 284).





     2) Added the new namelist switch PFRALT (default is FALSE).
When PFRALT is TRUE METAR reports with missing station pressure
and non-missing altimeter setting are processed by calculating
PSTN directly from the altimeter setting.  These reports are
assigned a new report type 187(mass)/287(wind) to uniquely
identify them.  About ~93% of METAR reports contain an altimeter
setting. [MAIN, SFCDTA, W3FIZZ]
          a. In the case of PFRALT=FALSE or missing altimeter setting, if
the surface land report has a missing PSTN then it is calculated from PMSL if
it is non-missing and the reports are assigned a report type 183(mass)/
284(wind) [unless the elevation is < 7.5 meters in which case PSTN is set to
PMSL and a report type 181(mass)/281(wind) is assigned].  If PMSL is also
missing, the report is skipped.  This is unchanged from before.
          b. In the case of PFRALT=TRUE, the altimeter setting is encoded
into the PREPBUFR file (assuming it is non-missing).  The RUC reads the
altimeter setting, not the PSTN, for the METAR reports.
          c. See I.1.d for more on why this change was made.

     3) All generated category 6 reports now store moisture as
specific humidity in g/kg rather than as dewpoint depression in x
10 degrees C.  The only category 6 types that currently contain
moisture are some ACARS aircraft and some flight-level RECCOS.
[MAIN, GETC06, IW3UNPBF]

     4) Added namelist switch FLACMS which, when TRUE (default),
flags all ACARS moisture data with a quality mark of 15 so they
are not assimilated.  Prior to this switch, the ACARS moisture
data were always flagged.  All versions currently use the default
FLACMS=TRUE, thus ACARS moisture is still not assimilated. [MAIN,
FIZZ01, PARM CARDS]

     5) The BUFR mnemonic table was updated to include new
mnemonics PFC_MOD, ZFC_MOD, UFC_MOD, VFC_MOD, TFC_MOD, QFC_MOD,
PWF_MOD, PW1F_MOD, PW2F_MOD, PW3F_MOD and PW4F_MOD.  These are
not filled at the current time but are designed to temporarily
hold the native model forecast (first guess) data interpolated to
the observation locations.  The ETA R3DVAR program will soon
contain a postprocessing step that will store the Eta model guess
here. As always, the mnemonics PFC, ZFC, UFC, VFC, TFC, QFC, PWF,
PW1F, PW2F, PW3F and PW4F hold the global model first guess in
all networks.  Eventually these will hold the native model guess
in all networks and the *_MOD mnemonics will be removed.

II. OPERATIONAL CHANGES SPECIFIC TO A DATA TYPE

  A. CHANGES TO ACARS DATA PROCESSING

     1) Moisture data is now processed as follows: The moisture
quality must be good (dump file mnemonic MSTQ = 0 only).  If this
is the case, the routine looks for non-missing mixing ratio (dump
file mnemonic MIXR).  If mixing ratio is found, the routine
converts it to specific humidity (g/kg) and stores it in the
category 6 output (see I.3).  If mixing ratio is not found, the
routine looks for non-missing relative humidity (dump file
mnemonic REHU).  If relative humidity is found, the routine
converts it to specific humidity (g/kg) and stores it in the
category 6 output (see I.3).  Prior to this, MSTQ was not
examined and only MIXR was read for moisture.  The changes here
result in many more ACARS reports available to PREPDATA with
specific humidity, and all with hopefully better quality than
before. (The new namelist switch FLACMS is set to TRUE, so
moisture is flagged with quality mark 15 and not assimilated by
any analyses.  See I.4) [IW3UNPBF]

     2) W3LIB routine GBLEVENTS was modified to bypass virtual
temperature processing for message type "AIRCAR".  The virtual
temperature had been generated for those ACARS reports with
moisture, but because the moisture quality mark was flagged, the
resultant virtual temperature was flagged and thus was not
assimilated.  This was an oversight, but since there had been so
few ACARS reports with moisture it had gone unnoticed.  Now,
there are many more ACARS reports with moisture (see II.A.1). 
The ACARS temperature will remain sensible. [GBLEVENTS}


  B. CHANGES TO SURFACE MARINE DATA PROCESSING

     1) Subroutine IW3UNPBF was modified to change the ON29
report type (T29) from 533 to 532 for surface marine automated
tide gauge reports (BUFR type 001, subtype 005) in the "sfcshp"
data dump group.  This report type now agrees with that in the
quips processing.  [MAIN, IW3UNPBF, SFCDTA, ISSEL]

     2) RUC only: All buoys (moored or drifters) with missing
pressure but valid wind are now stored with report type 282 and
pressure set to 1013.3 mb (like the Atlas Buoys).  Prior to this,
these were not processed (and they still aren't for the other
versions).  The program GETBUFR isn't currently setup to accept
report type 282, so these reports will not be used by the RUC
analysis at the current time.  [MAIN, SFCDTA]



  C. CHANGES TO SURFACE LAND DATA PROCESSING

     1) AVN, FNL only: Since namelist switch PFRALT is set to
TRUE for these versions (see I.2), surface METAR reports with
report type 187(mass)/287(wind) are now encoded into the PREPBUFR
file. However, the SSI does not assimilate these reports because
their observation errors are now set to missing.  There will be
fewer report types 181(mass)/281(wind) in the PREPBUFR file now
because METAR reports with elevation < 7.5 meters and with valid
PMSL and altimeter are reassigned to report types 187/287. Report
type 181 is assimilated by the SSI but not report type 281. 
Eventually the type 187 reports will be assimilated, more than
making up for the current reduction in type 181 reports. [MAIN,
SFCDTA, W3FIZZ, PARM CARDS, OBS_ERR TABLE]

     2) ETA only: Since namelist switch PFRALT is set to TRUE for
this version (see I.2), surface METAR reports with report type
187(mass)/287(wind) are now encoded into the PREPBUFR file. 
These are assimilated by the R3DVAR (with the same observation
errors as report types 181/281. [MAIN, SFCDTA, W3FIZZ, PARM
CARDS, OBS_ERR TABLE]

     3) RUC only: Since namelist switch PFRALT is set to TRUE for
this version (see I.2), surface METAR reports with report type
187(mass)/287(wind) are now encoded into the PREPBUFR file. The
RUC analysis assimilates these reports just as it had done before
when they received report types of either 181/281 or 183/284. 
This is a result of a change to program GETBUFR which adds 187
and 287 to the list of reports types treated as surface land
data.  As before, the altimeter setting rather than the pressure,
is actually read by GETBUFR. [MAIN, SFCDTA, W3FIZZ, PARM CARDS,
OBS_ERR TABLE]

     4) CDAS only: Since namelist switch PFRALT is set to FALSE
for this version (see I.2), there is no change.  The CDAS does
not process METAR data.  [MAIN, SFCDTA, W3FIZZ, PARM CARDS]

     5) For METAR reports with missing wind direction and wind
speed less than or equal to 3 meters/sec, new mnemonics SOB (wind
speed observation) and SQM (wind speed q.m.) are encoded into the
PREPBUFR file while the mnemonics UOB and VOB are now missing. 
Prior to this, wind reports were skipped when the direction was
missing (and this is still the case for types other than METAR
and for any types with speed > 3 meters/sec).  The RUC (and maybe
eventually other versions) will eventually assimilate the wind
speed for these "light" METAR winds which report a variable
direction.  Note: The METAR decoder was changed at 15Z on 12
December 2000 to generate a missing wind speed when the wind
direction was reported as variable; before it set the direction
to 360 degrees. [MAIN, SFCDTA, W3FIZZ, FIZZ01, BUFRTABLE]

     6) The mnemonics DDO and FFO are no longer encoded into the
PREPBUFR file for any surface land data.  The assumption was that
no analysis used these data.  However, that was proved wrong when
it was later discovered that the RUC GETBUFR routine was reading
DDO and FFO rather than UOB and VOB for surface land reports (and
this was the case for some other data types as well).  A crisis
change to GETBUFR at 19Z on 11 January 2001 corrected the problem
by switching the read to UOB and VOB (hopefully this will occur
soon for other RUC report types as well). [MAIN, W3FIZZ, FIZZ01]


  D. CHANGES TO GOES SATELLITE SOUNDING/RADIANCE DATA PROCESSING

     1) Subroutine W3UNPKB7 was modified to bypass time window
checking on BUFR messages if the input time window values (IHE)
and (IHL) are .LE. -3 AND .GE. +2 hours, respectively.  Prior to
this the limits were .LE. -6 AND .GE. +6 hours, respectively. 
The AVN, FNL and CDAS versions now benefit from increased
computational efficiency.  (No operational data dumps are ever
outside the -3 hour to +2 hour time span.) [W3UNPKB7]

     2) Modified to not generate a station id if an 8-character
station id was already stored in the input goesnd dump file.
[This would indicate that the dump program DUPSAT had generated
the id, allowing for all reports to have a unique station id even
if the PREPDATA processing is multi-tasked (as it is in
operations).]  If an 8-character station id is not found, as
might be the case for historical reruns (or as is currently the
case since the change to DUPSAT is not scheduled to be
implemented until at least 17 January 2001), then it is generated
here as before except an 8-character id is now created.
[W3UNPKB7]

     3) Modified to recognize decoded reports with an 8-character
station id.  The satellite indicator is moved from position 6 of
the id to position 8 (necessitating a coincidental change in both
R3DVAR and SSI). [MAIN, GOESDG]













  E. CHANGES TO SATELLITE WIND DATA PROCESSING

     1) Modifed to read and properly process the OLD low-density
NESDIS satwinds, for historical reruns.  Changes in the logic
since these data became obsolete had made this impossible until
now.  [IW3UNPBF]

     2) Modified to not generate a station id for all types if an
8-character station id was already stored in the input satwnd
dump file. [This would indicate that the dump program DUPSAT had
generated the id, allowing for all reports to have a unique
station id even if the PREPDATA processing is multi-tasked (as it
is in operations).]  If an 8-character station id is not found,
as might be the case for historical reruns (or as is currently
the case since the change to DUPSAT is not scheduled to be
implemented until at least 17 January 2001), then it is generated
here as before except an 8-character id is now created.
[IW3UNPBF]

     3) Modified to recognize decoded reports with an 8-character
station id. [MAIN, GETC06]
     

  F. CHANGES TO WIND PROFILER DATA PROCESSING  

     1) Subroutine W3UNPKB7 was modified to store the rainfall
rate (W3UNPKB7 Category 10) in units of mm/hour.  Prior to this
it was stored in units of 10**7 mm/sec (where it had been
incorrectly documented to be in units of 10**7 m/sec).  Since
rainfall rate for wind profiler reports is not encoded into the
PREPBUFR file, this change has no effect on production. 
[W3UNPKB7]

     2) Subroutine W3UNPKB7 was modified to bypass time window
checking on BUFR messages if the input time window values (IHE)
and (IHL) are .LE. -3 AND .GE. +2 hours, respectively.  Prior to
this the limits were .LE. -6 AND .GE. +6 hours, respectively. 
The AVN, FNL and CDAS versions now benefit from increased
computational efficiency.  (No operational data dumps are ever
outside the -3 hour to +2 hour time span.) [W3UNPKB7]










     3) Tropical wind profilers with the report ids 91492, PSMAN,
PSNAU, 91609, PSGAL or PSPIU arrive as PIBAL bulletins on the GTS
and are decoded as PIBALS in our /dcom database.  The report
types for these are now set to 223 (wind profiler) rather than
221 (PIBAL) as before.  They are now written into "PROFLR" BUFR
messages and are subject to wind profiler quality control by the
PROFCQC program.  They also now receive wind profiler observation
errors.  The resulting intermingled "ADPUPA" and "PROFLR" message
types necessitated a change to program LISTHEADERS to read
through the entire PREPBUFR file in the reordering of message
types. [MAIN, STOROB]  

  G. CHANGES TO VAD WIND DATA PROCESSING  

     1) Subroutine W3UNPKB7 was modified to bypass time window
checking on BUFR messages if the input time window values (IHE)
and (IHL) are .LE. -3 AND .GE. +2 hours, respectively.  Prior to
this the limits were .LE. -6 AND .GE. +6 hours, respectively. 
The AVN, FNL and CDAS versions now benefit from increased
computational efficiency.  (No operational data dumps are ever
outside the -3 hour to +2 hour time span.) [W3UNPKB7]


  F. CHANGES TO ERS SCATTEROMETER WIND DATA PROCESSING  

     1) Subroutine W3UNPKB7 was modified to bypass time window
checking on BUFR messages if the input time window values (IHE)
and (IHL) are .LE. -3 AND .GE. +2 hours, respectively.  Prior to
this the limits were .LE. -6 AND .GE. +6 hours, respectively. 
The AVN, FNL and CDAS versions now benefit from increased
computational efficiency.  (No operational data dumps are ever 
outside the -3 hour to +2 hour time span.) [W3UNPKB7]

     2) Modified to not generate a station id if an 8-character
station id was already stored in the input erscat dump file.
[This would indicate that the reprocessing program DATASORT had
generated the id, allowing for all reports to have a unique
station id even if the PREPDATA processing is multi-tasked (as it
is in operations).]  If an 8-character station id is not found,
as might be the case for historical reruns (or as is currently
the case since the change to DATASORT is not scheduled to be
implemented until at least 17 January 2001), then it is generated
here as before except an 8-character id is now created.
[W3UNPKB7]

     3) Modified to recognize decoded ERS scatterometer reports
with an 8-character station id.  [MAIN, GETSCATT]




III. NON-OPERATIONAL CHANGES SPECIFIC TO A DATA TYPE


  A. CHANGES TO QUIKSCAT SCATTEROMETER WIND DATA PROCESSING

     1) Subroutine W3UNPKB7 was modified to bypass time window
checking on BUFR messages if the input time window values (IHE)
and (IHL) are .LE. -3 AND .GE. +2 hours, respectively.  Prior to
this the limits were .LE. -6 AND .GE. +6 hours, respectively. 
The AVN, FNL and CDAS versions now benefit from increased
computational efficiency.  (No operational data dumps are ever
outside the -3 hour to +2 hour time span.) [W3UNPKB7]

     2) Modified to not generate a station id if an 8-character
station id was already stored in the input qkswnd dump file.
[This would indicate that the reprocessing program DCODQUIKSCAT
had generated the id, allowing for all reports to have a unique
station id even if the PREPDATA processing is multi-tasked (as it
is in operations).]  If an 8-character station id is not found,
as might be the case for historical reruns (or as is currently
the case since the change to DCODQUIKSCAT is not scheduled to be
implemented until at least 17 January 2001), then it is generated
here as before except an 8-character id is now created.
[W3UNPKB7]

     3) Modified to recognize decoded QUIKSCAT scatterometer
reports with an 8-character station id.  [MAIN, GETSCATT]


  B. CHANGES TO ATOVS SATELLITE RETRIEVAL PROCESSING

     1) A modification was made to subroutines W3ATOVSUNP and
W3XTOVSEDS to account for a current NESDIS error in the scaling
of the bottom pressure value (PBOT).  If the scaling is
corrected, these routines will still work without being changed. 
A sanity check is now performed on PBOT, and the retrieval is
skipped if it fails.  If the filter flag (mnemonic TOFF)is
missing, these routines set it to -99 instead of 0 as before. 
This value of -99 alerts PREPDATA to the fact that the filter
flag is missing, so if the PREPDATA switch TR80KM is FALSE, every
eleventh retrieval is processed to simulate the 250 km sampling. 
[W3ATOVSUNP, W3XTOVSEDS]
