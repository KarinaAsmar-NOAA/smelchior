MEMORANDUM TO:  Record
FROM:           Dennis A. Keyser -- W/NP22
Subject:        Changes to 3DVAR/OI/SSI-Data Preprocessor
                (February 17, 1998 Version -- UPDATE # 4)

The February 17, 1998 version of the data preprocessor program
(PREPDATA) was updated for the fourth time.  UPDATE #4 was
implemented on 1200 UTC 16 July 1998.  Except where noted, the
changes below affect all three versions, 3DVAR, OI, and SSI.

*********************  U P D A T E   # 3  ***********************

I.  GENERAL CHANGES

     1) Added new namelist logical switch FLGOES which is a 4-
word array allowing all GOES sounding/retrieval reports from
every other even or odd GOES satellite to be flagged for non-use
by the analysis (needed when two even satellites or two odd
satellites are producing data but only one is to be used
operationally).  Character 6 of the GOES station id is now unique
for two different, but consecutive, even or odd satellites.  This
does NOT apply to GOES radiances. [MAIN, GOESDG] 

 
II.  OPERATIONAL CHANGES SPECIFIC TO A DATA TYPE

   A) CHANGES TO WIND PROFILER DATA PROCESSING

     1) Modified Cat. 11 (height, horizontal significance,
vertical significance) and VAD wind header (station id)
processing to account for updates to BUFRTABLE mnemonics in
/dcom. [W3UNPKB7]


   B) CHANGES TO GOES SOUNDING/RETRIEVAL/RADIANCE DATA PROCESSING

     1) Changed character 6 of GOES station id to be unique for
two different, but consecutive, even or odd satellite ids. 
(Every other even or odd satellite id now gets the same character
6 tag.) [W3UNPKB7]

     2) All GOES-10 layer PW retrievals are now being flagged
with q.m.=15 so that they will not be assimilated by the analysis
during the test period.  This does not apply to GOES radiances
which do not have a q.m. [DATACARDS]




   C) CHANGES TO GOES SATELLITE WIND DATA PROCESSING

     1) All GOES-10 satellite wind reports (all types) are now
being flagged with q.m.=15 so that they will not be assimilated
by the analysis during the test period. [DATACARDS]
