CRISIS!!!!
Subroutine IW3UNPBF was modified to handle expanded quality
information in the EUMETSAT wind reports in the input "satwnd"
data dump files.  On 5 June 2001, EUMETSAT is adding quality
information which is not based on a first guess, in addition to
quality information currently present which is based on a first
guess.  The quality information based on a first guess will
continue to be decoded here.  [IW3UNPBF]
