MEMORANDUM TO:  Record
FROM:           Dennis A. Keyser -- W/NMC22
Subject:        Changes to IBM-SP Data Preprocessor (PREPDATA)
                (February 17, 2000 Version -- 
                 ETA DATACARD UPDATE)

Implemented 12Z 23 October 2001:

ETA only:  Expanded the time window for processing VAD winds
from -1.0 to +0.99 hours about PREPBUFR center time to -2.0 to
+1.99 hours in order to pickup VAD wind reports between -1.5 and
-1.01 hours and between +1.00 and +1.50 hours (the dump window is
+/- 1.50 hours about PREPBUFR center time).  [Namelist switch
MWINDO changed from -1,0 to -2,1.]

ETA only:  Expanded the time window for processing wind profilers
from -1.0 to +1.99 hours about PREPBUFR center time to -2.0 to
+1.99 hours.  Although the dump window is +/- 1.50 hours about
PREPBUFR center time, no additional reports will be processed right
now because the wind profilers report right on the hour.  This
could change in the future, however.  [Namelist switch NWINDO
changed from -1,1 to -2,1.]
