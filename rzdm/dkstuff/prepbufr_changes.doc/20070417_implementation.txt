MEMORANDUM TO:  Record
FROM:           Dennis A. Keyser -- W/NMC22
Subject:        Changes to IBM-SP Data Preprocessor (PREPDATA)
                (September 9, 2004 Version, Update #5 -- 
                 DATACARD UPDATE # 5.1 - NETWORKS: AFOSPLT,
                 CDAS, CDC, NAM; DATACARD UPDATE # 5.2 - NETWORKS:
                 GDAS, GFS)

Implemented 12Z 17 April 2007:

ALL: METEOSAT-9 (satellite id 56) satellite derived IR and visible winds are
flagged.  These winds have now replaced METEOSAT-8 (satellite id 55) in the
upstream "satwnd" dumps and in the PREPBUFR file.  (Like METEOSAT-8, whose
winds had also been flagged here, METEOSAT-9 is a second generation METEOSAT
satellite.)  [Namelist switch JSWIND(:,6,1) and JSWIND(:,6,3) (even EUMETSAT
conventional IR and VIS winds at all latitude bands) changed from 0 to 199.
This allows METEOSAT-7 (satellite id 54, thus also an even EUMETSAT), IR and
visible winds to continue to be processed w/o flagging.]
