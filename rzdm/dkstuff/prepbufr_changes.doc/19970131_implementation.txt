MEMORANDUM TO:  Record
FROM:           Dennis A. Keyser -- W/NP22
Subject:        Changes to OI/SSI-Data Preprocessor
                (July 12, 1995 Version -- UPDATE # 7)

The July 12, 1995 version of the data preprocessor program
(PREPDATA) was updated for the seventh time.  UPDATE #7 was
implemented on 1200 UTC 31 January 1997 on the CRAY.  All changes
now affect only OBUFR = TRUE switch.  Except where noted, the
changes below affect both the GLOBAL and RGL/ETA models.
At implementation time, PREPDATA still used ON29 file input.  The
conversion to JBUFR input was as follows:

     AVN (530,532) 12Z 04 February
     FNL (830,860) 12Z 05 February
     MESO (667)    12Z 11 February
     EDAS (881)    12Z 12 February
     ERL  (240)    12Z 12 February
     RGL  (340)    12Z 12 February

I.  GENERAL CHANGES

      1) New NAMELIST switch IACFTL(4) replaces IACARL.  Can now
specify FLOOR for all 4 aircraft types (default is IACFTL =
100,3*2286).  If reports are below floor, they are flagged for
non-use by analysis.  TEMPORARY: If AIREP/PIREP or ASDAR/AMDAR
report below floor, it is tossed rather than flagged.  ACARS
below floor are flagged.  NOTE: FOR NOW, THE NEW IW3GAD ACTUALLY
FILTERS OUT AIREP/PIREP AND ASDAR/AMDAR REPORTS BELOW FLOOR
BEFORE THEY EVER GET TO PREPDATA. (MAIN, GETC06)
  - for ON29 input: GBL: = default
                    RGL: = default for 1-3, IACFTL(4)=0
                           (as before)
  - for BUFR input: GBL: = default
                    RGL: = default for 1-3, IACFTL(4)=0









      2) New namelist switch AIFNOW, when set to FALSE for any of
the 4 aircraft types, will flag that type's mass report for non-
use by the analysis when the corresponding wind report is missing
(default is AIFNOW = 4*FALSE).  TEMPORARY: If AIFNOW=F for
AIREP/PIREP or ASDAR/AMDAR reports, it is tossed rather than
flagged.  ACARS with AIFNOW=FALSE are flagged.  NOTE: FOR NOW,
THE NEW IW3GAD ACTUALLY FILTERS OUT ALL TYPES OF REPORTS WITH
MISSING WIND BEFORE THEY EVER GET TO PREPDATA. (MAIN, GETC06)
  - for ON29 input: GBL: = default
                    RGL: = default 
   - for BUFR input: GBL: = default
                     RGL: = default

      3) New namelist switch IPRFTP added to specify type of
input wind profiler data set (=1 - WMO BUFR; =2 - JBUFR). 
Default is IPRFTP = 1. (MAIN, PREP).
  - for ON29 input: GBL: = default
                    RGL: = default
  - for BUFR input: GBL: = IPRFTP=2
                    RGL: = IPRFTP=2

      4) Added call to new subroutine W3UNPK77, to decode reports
from JBUFR wind profiler data set when NAMELIST switch IPRFTP=2.
(MAIN, PREP).

      5) GBL and RGL BUFR input: Namelist switches JSURFM(3),
JSURFM(7) set to 9999 to exclude pmsl bogus from processing
(these are not yet available in bufr dumps). (MAIN, SFCDTA).

      6) GBL and RGL BUFR input: Namelist switch MBOGUS set to
FALSE to exclude satellite moisture bogus from processing (this
is not available in bufr dumps and in fact is not longer
processed by NESDIS/SAB). (MAIN, PREP).

      7) RGL BUFR input: Namelist switch IEDSTP set to 2 to input
TOVS retrievals in unpacked NMCEDS format from JBUFR dump file.
(MAIN, SATEDS).

      8) GBL BUFR input: Namelist switch TOVBFR set to TRUE to
input TOVS 40-level retrievals and radiances from JBUFR dump
file.  (In version 6, no TOVS data was present in PREPBUFR file.)
(MAIN, PREP).
