TOVS (NOAA-12) retrievals are no longer processed operationally.
(TOVBFR set to FALSE.)

Indian radiosonde mass reports are now processed operationally.

Wind profiler data is present in the PREPBUFR files (-3 to +2-hours
about cycle time) but it has never been (up to this point)
assimilated by the SSI-analyses.
