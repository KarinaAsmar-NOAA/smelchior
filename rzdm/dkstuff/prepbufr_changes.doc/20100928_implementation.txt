MEMORANDUM TO:  Record
FROM:           Dennis A. Keyser -- W/NMC22
Subject:        Changes to IBM-SP Data Preprocessor (PREPDATA)
                (September 9, 2004 Version, Update #9 -- 
                 DATACARD UPDATE # 9.0 - NETWORK: RTMA)

Implemented 12Z 28 September 2010:

RTMA:
     - SSM/I wind speed and tpw reports are no longer processed.  [Namelist
       switches JPSSMI(:,1) and JPSSMI(:,2) changed from 0 to 9999.]
     - QuikSCAT scatterometer wind reports no longer processed.  [Namelist
       switch JPQKSD changed from 6*0 to 6*9999.]
     - ASCAT scatterometer wind reports now processed in all six latitude
       bands (but actually limited to dump domain).  [Namelist switch JPASCD(6)
       added and set to 6*0.]
     - The earliest and latest times for accepting ASCAT scatterometer wind
       reports is set to -6 and 0 hours, respectively, relative to PREPBUFR
       center time (this is the same as the dump window).  [Namelist switch
       IAWNDO(2) added and set to -6, 0.]
     - WindSAT scatterometer wind reports now processed in all six latitude
       bands (but actually limited to dump domain).  [Namelist switch JPWDCD(6)
       changed from 6*9999 to 6*0.]
     - The earliest and latest times for accepting WindSAT scatterometer wind
       reports is set to -6 and 0 hours, respectively, relative to PREPBUFR
       center time (this is the same as the dump window).  [Namelist switch
       IWWNDO(2) changed from the default of -3, +3 to -6, 0.]
     - Satellite-derived wind reports from GOES IR, GOES water vapor imager
       (cloud-top and deep-layer), JMA IR, JMA visible, AQUA/TERRA (MODIS) IR,
       and AQUA/TERRA (MODIS) water vapor imager (cloud-top and deep-layer) now
       processed.  [Namelist switch JSWIND changed from 9999 to 0000.]
     - Satellite-derived wind reports from EUMETSAT METEOSAT-7 IR and
       EUMETSAT METEOSAT-7 visible now processed.  Satellite-derived wind
       reports from EUMETSAT METEOSAT-9 IR and EUMETSAT METEOSAT-9 visible now
       processed but flagged with quality mark 15 (can, at most, only be
       monitored by analysis).  [Namelist switch JSWIND changed from 9999 to
       0199.]
     - Satellite-derived wind reports from GOES visible, JMA water vapor imager
       (cloud-top and deep-layer), and EUMETSAT water vapor imager (cloud-top
       and deep-layer), now processed but flagged with quality mark 15 (can, at
       most, only be monitored by analysis).  [Namelist switch JSWIND changed
       from 9999 to 0099.]
     - The earliest time for accepting satellite-derived wind reports from all
       types except EUMETSAT IR, EUMETSAT water vapor imager (cloud-top and
       deep-layer), and EUMETSAT visible is set to -2.5 hours, relative to
       PREPBUFR center time (this is the same as the dump window).  [Namelist
       switch SWINDO_e changed from -050 to -250.]
     - The earliest time for accepting satellite-derived wind reports from
       EUMETSAT IR, EUMETSAT water vapor imager (cloud-top and deep-layer), and
       EUMETSAT visible is set to -0.75 hours, relative to PREPBUFR center time
       (this is the same as the dump window).  [Namelist switch SWINDO_e
       changed from -050 to -075.]
     - The latest time for accepting satellite-derived wind reports from all
       types except EUMETSAT IR, EUMETSAT water vapor imager (cloud-top and
       deep-layer), and EUMETSAT visible is set to +2.5 hours, relative to
       PREPBUFR center time (this is actually limited to the dump window of
       +0.5 hours).  [Namelist switch SWINDO_l changed from +050 to +250.]
     - The latest time for accepting satellite-derived wind reports from
       EUMETSAT IR, EUMETSAT water vapor imager (cloud-top and deep-layer), and
       EUMETSAT visible is set to +0.25 hours, relative to PREPBUFR center time
       (this is the same as the dump window).  [Namelist switch SWINDO_l
       changed from +050 to +025.]
