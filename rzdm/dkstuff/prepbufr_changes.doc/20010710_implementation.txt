MEMORANDUM TO:  Record
FROM:           Dennis A. Keyser -- NP22
Subject:        Changes to IBM-SP Data Preprocessor (PREPDATA)
                (February 17, 2000 Version -- UPDATE # 5)


The February 17, 2000 data preprocessor program (PREPDATA) was
updated for the fifth time.  UPDATE #5 was implemented on the
IBM-SP machine at 12Z on July 10, 2001.  Except where noted, the
changes below affect all five versions: ETA, AVN, FNL, RUC and
CDAS.

**************** I B M - S P   U P D A T E   # 5  ***************

I.  GENERAL CHANGES


     1) Added new subroutine TIMCHK which performs time window
checking for all reports.  This step had been included in
subroutine RPTLBL, but it was separated to allow separate time
window checking to be performed on sounding/radiance,
precipitable waterm and cloud-top reports all generated from a
single decoded GOES sounding/radiance/retrieval report which
otherwise only needs to call subroutine RPTLBL a single time for
each decoded report. [MAIN, PREP, RPTLBL, TIMCHK, GETC06, SATEDS,
SATBFR, GOESCHK, SFCDTA, GETSMI, GETSCATT]

     2) Existing namelist switches GOESND, GOESPW and GOESRD
expanded from logical scalars to 1-dimensional arrays of size 2. 
The first word refers to GOES 5x5 fov sounding/radiance/retrieval
data (low-resolution, as before) and the second word refers to
GOES 1x1 fov sounding/radiance/retrieval data (high-resolution,
new).  All default to 2*FALSE. [MAIN, PREP, GOESDG, DATACARDS]

     3) Added new namelist switch GOESCT, a logical 1-dimensional
array of length 2 which controls the processing of GOES cloud top
reports from either 5x5 fov sounding/radiance/retrieval data
(word 1) or 1x1 fov data (word 2).  Defaults to 2*FALSE. [MAIN,
PREP, GOESDG, DATACARDS]

     







     4) Modified namelist switches IWINDO, SATMST, ISATLS, IRTRV
and KTOP to be 3-dimensional arrays of length (5,4,4) rather than
2-dimensional arrays of length (5,6).  The second dimension now
refers specifically to the satellite (even-1, odd-1, even-2, odd-
2 for GOES; even, odd, reserved, reserved for RTOVS/ATOVS).  The
third dimension refers to the type of report being processed
(RTOVS/ATOVS soundings/radiances, GOES soundings/radiances, GOES
precipitable water retrievals, GOES cloud top retrievals).  See
code for defaults. (Note: There are two new possible values for
IRTRV - 118 which means exclude only unknown path types and 4
which means process pnly unknown path types.  Both apply only to
GOES data since cloud top reports have unknown path type.) 
[MAIN, SATEDS, SNDTBL, SATBFR, GOESDG, DATACARDS]

     5) As a result of I.4, namelist switches JSATLS and FLGOES
are no longer needed and are removed. [MAIN, SNDTBL, GOESDG,
DATACARDS]

     6) Modified subroutine SNDTBL to add new input argument
IDSAT (length 4, where 1 is GOES even-1 sat. or RTOVS/ATOVS even
sat, 2 is GOES odd-1 sat. or RTOVS.ATOVS odd sat., 3 is GOES
even-2 sat., and 3 is GOES odd-2 sat.).  These replace input
arguments IEVSAT and IODSAT, and allow the pairs of even and odd
GOES satellite numbers to to printed out in the table
information. [MAIN, SATEDS, SNDTBL, SATBFR, GOESDG]

     7) Changed the length of the array holding counts of total 
satellite (RTOVS/ATOVS or GOES) sounding/radiance/retrieval data
(NUMOB)from (5,4,2,2) to (5,4,2,4,4); and changed the length of
the number kept (KEPOB), and number of moisture data kept (MSTOB)
from (5,4,2) to (5,4,2,4).  These changes allow counts to be kept
based on pairs of even or odd GOES satellites rather than just a
single even and a single odd satellite (the expansion of the
fourth element in NUMOB from 2 to 4) and based on the 4 types of
reports that can be processed (the new fifth element in NUMOB and
the new fourth element in MSTOB and KEPOB. [MAIN, SATEDS, SNDTBL,
SATBFR, GOESDG]

     8) Subroutine SNDTBL has been extensively modified to
present an improved satellite sounding/radiance/retrieval table,
especially for the GOES data. [MAIN, SNDTBL]

     9) Added a new Table D sequence PLEVLG which will be used to define the
Table A entry GOESND pressure level sequence.  It is different from PLEVL
(which still defines pressure level sequence for all other Table A entries) in
that in includes the cloud top information sequence (CTINFO which itself
contains the new sequences CTPEVN, CTPBAK and CTPPST) and it doesn't include
any wind information sequence.  Also, because of this change, PLEVL no longer
includes the precipitable water information sequence since no Table A entries
need it. [BUFRTABLE] 


II. OPERATIONAL CHANGES SPECIFIC TO A DATA TYPE

  A. CHANGES TO WIND PROFILER DATA PROCESSING

     1) Subroutine IW3UNPBF modified to remove a temporary fix
which hardwired the vertical significance (VSIG) to 2 (if
surface, never was) or 64 (winds-by-height) for wind profilers
from PIBAL bulletins.  This had been in place because the
profilers from PIBAL bulletins do not contain VSIG.  The decoder
has since been modified to hardwire these values. [IW3UNPBF]


  B. CHANGES TO GOES DATA PROCESSING

     1) Added new subroutine GOESCHK which performs the checks on
GOES sounding/radiance/retrieval reports that had been done in
subroutine GOESDG [e.g., report outside domain, outside time
window, over land (when only want over ocean), over ocean (when
only want oner land), or with unwanted path].  This makes the
code more consise now that these checks are performed separately
on sounding/radiance, precipitable water, and cloud-top reports
all generated from a single decoded GOES
sounding/radiance/retrieval report. [MAIN, GOESDG, GOESCHK]

     2) Subroutine W3UNPKB7 modified to generate proper station
id character 8 for reports with an unknown satellite path (either
K or S for even-1 or even-2, or N or T for odd-1 or odd-2
satellite).  It also writes an H in the first character of the
station id for 1x1 fov reports to identify them as such.  Note:
All of this is invoked only if the station id wasn't already
generated in the upstream program BUFR_DUPSAT.  [W3UNPKB7]

     3) Subroutine W3UNPKB7 modified to recognize BUFR
type/subtype 003/002 (GOES 1x1 fov data) as part of the "GOESND"
dump file.  Reports in this subtype currently do not have any
decoded profile levels or radiance channels.  Reports in this
subtype write cloud cover (BUFR c.f. 0-20-010, per cent) in
output category 8, code figure 258 rather than cloud amount as
the old 5x5 fov (003/001) reports do.  [W3UNPKB7]











     4) Eta and RUC versions only: Can now read in GOES
sounding/radiance/retrievals reports from GOES 1x1 fov (high-
resolution) data, included in the GOESND data dump file under
BUFR type/subtype 003/002.  Currently, only GOES cloud top
retrievals are available in the input dump.  The GOES cloud top
reports are encoded into the PREPBUFR file under report type 151
(switch GOESCT=FALSE,TRUE).  They have station id's with first
character H, and the eighth character identifies the satellite
under the unknown path type combinations (see II.A.2).
Information encoded into report type 151 include the new
mnemonics CDTP (cloud top pressure observation), TOCC (cloud
cover observation), GCDTT (cloud top temperature observation),
CDTP_QM (cloud top pressure quality marker), CDTP_PC (cloud top
pressure program code), and CDTP_RC (cloud top pressure reason
code).  In addition, slots are left open for other programs to
someday encode CDTP_AN (cloud top pressure analyzed value),
CDTP_FC (cloud top pressure forecast value), and CDTP_OE (cloud
top pressure observation error).  Currently, a report will not be
written into the PREPBUFR file if the cloud top presssure
observation is missing.  These data are not yet assimilated
(report type 151 is not recognized), but will eventually be
assimilated into the RUC analysis and used directly by the Eta
model.  [MAIN, FILLX, SNDTBL, GOESDG, W3FIZZ, FIZZ01, BUFRTABLE] 

     5) Subroutine GOESDG has been extensively modified to
streamline the processing of GOES reports. [MAIN, GOESDG]

     6) Set GOES precipitable water report reason codes (PW1R,
PW2R, PW3R, PW4R) to 100 (were missing). [MAIN, FIZZ01]


  C. CHANGES TO SSM/I DATA PROCESSING

     1) Set SSM/I precipitable water report reason code (PWR) to
100 (was missing). [MAIN, FIZZ01]

     2) Set SSM/I rainfall rate reason code (REQ6_RC) to 100 (was
missing). [MAIN, FIZZ01]
