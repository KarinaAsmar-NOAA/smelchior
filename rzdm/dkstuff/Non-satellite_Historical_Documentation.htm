&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TAMDAR contract with NWS
in the process of being re-negotiated. &nbsp;An increased amount of
data from all providers (vs. before the April 2009 shut down) now
available in both the AirDAT
feed (~6/19/2009,&nbsp;we do not yet use these data) and in the
GSD-MADIS </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">feed
(7/1/2009). &nbsp;We are dumping the latter data and
they are being assimilated again in the NAM-GSI and RUC analysis.
Note: This contract was re-negotiated ~8/7/2009 and will not expire
until at least 27 October 2009.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NCEP&nbsp;stopped receiving TAMDAR
data from the MADIS-feed (all 3 types) (this is assimilated in the NAM
and RUC). &nbsp;GSD changed their definition of TAMDAR data in the
netCDF files they provide to NCEP - it was not advertised
to&nbsp;NCEP/NCO. &nbsp;(Data counts actually started going down in the
dumps ~08/12/2009/1800UTC). &nbsp;This was corrected at 08/26/2008/1700
UTC via an emergency implementation at NCEP to recognize the new TAMDAR
definition. TAMDAR data began flowing again (in pre-8/12/09
numbers). &nbsp;It was later discovered that since this time, no TAMDAR
moisture (RH) was being received. This turned out to be another issue
with the netCDF source files and the MADIS library. &nbsp;NCEP/NCO
implemented a patch to the library on 10/14/2009/1500UTC which turned
the moisture data back on.<br>

profiler data (tank b002/xx007 and dump "proflr", used in the GFS, NAM
and RUC analyses), spectral moment data (tank b002/xx010, not dumped or
used by any analyses) and Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS)
temperature profile data (tank b002/xx012 and dump "rassda", used in
the RUC analysis, monitored in the GFS and NAM analyses) are now again
available, this time from the alternate GSD/MADIS feed. &nbsp;This is
temporary until the primary NWS feed is restored in approximately two
months. &nbsp;(See 10/01/2008 entry for more information.)<br>

winds, including&nbsp;acoustic sounders (SODARs)] and b002/xx012 (MAP
RASS,
along with NPN RASS), via feed from
GSD MADIS (decoded into BUFR from netCDF format). &nbsp;The MAP winds
are being written into the "proflr" dumps in the NAM/NDAS, GFS/GDAS and
RUC networks. &nbsp;They are included in the PREPBUFR file with report
type 227&nbsp;in the NAM/NDAS and RUC networks. &nbsp;These&nbsp;are
not monitored or assimilated in any network. </tt><tt>The MAP

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Multi-Agency Profiler (MAP) wind

levels that was introduced back when these data were re-introduced into
the NCEP data processing (via GSD MADIS feed) on 11/25/2008. The
reported heights were assumed to be height above ground and the station
elevation was added to them to obtain height above sea-level. In
reality, the reported heights were already height above sea-level, so
the station elevation was being added to the heights above ground twice.</span><br>

resp.) to cease. The former was in the&nbsp;ops "proflr" dump and was
being slated for testing in the Global GSI (it was kept out of ops
PREPBUFR files). &nbsp;The NCEP decoder was modified to again process
these&nbsp;on 05/22/2014 however the data were routed to /dcomdev for

TAC-fed FM 18 buoy&nbsp;tank b001/xx002 (which&nbsp;is&nbsp;a part of

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lightning data from Vaisala's&nbsp;National
Lightning Detection Network (NLDN - short range) and Long-range
Lightning Detection Network (LLDN)
are now ingestred&nbsp;into /dcom database tanks b007/xx001 and
b007/xx002, resp. &nbsp;These data are not yet dumped in any network.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The GFS/GDAS GSI now assimilates
tropical storm pseudo sea-level pressure observations using information
in the Q.C.'d tcvitals files. These get a report type of 112 and are
written to the post-analysis PREPBUFR files.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The t-12 NDAS now starts from a
global sigma first guess which reflects the relocation of tropical
systems (if any are present).<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The CDAS, GDAS and GFS networks
now dump the following oceanographic data types: "bathy" [eXpendable
BathyThermographs (XBT) and&nbsp;thermistor chain moorings {via GTS,
originating from WMO FM-63 (BATHY) format}],&nbsp;"tesac"
[Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) probes, Argo profiling floats,
moorings {via GTS, originating from WMO FM-64 (TESAC)
format}],&nbsp;and "trakob" [ThermoSalinoGraphs (TSG) {via GTS, originating from WMO&nbsp;FM-62 (TRACKOB) format}].
&nbsp;These data are not assimilated by any atmospheric analyses.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lightning data from
Vaisala's&nbsp;Long-range

Lightning Detection Network (NLDN - short range) are now dumped
by the RAP ("lghtng"). &nbsp;These data are not yet assimilated.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lightning data from the Long-range

&nbsp; BUFR-feed marine subsurface data, currently only in the form of glider data,&nbsp;now decoded into BUFR tank

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vaisala lightning data now
encrypted. Lightning data from Earth
