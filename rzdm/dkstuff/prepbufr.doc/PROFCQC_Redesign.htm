<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Redesign
of the NOAA/NCEP Wind Profiler Quality Control Module</span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dennis Keyser</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;NOAA/NWS/NCEP/EMC</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">03 January 2003</p>
<br>
<p>The NOAA/NCEP wind profiler quality control program, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">PREPOBS_PROFCQC</span>, was
designed
in the early 1990's to run in the RUC network and read in and process
data from the 36 original
NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) sites. The NPN profilers all reported on
the hour and all
reported winds, or missing data, on the same 43 height levels above
ground. The first 36 levels
were separated by 250 meters and the last seven levels were separated
by 1000 meters.</p>
<br>
<p>In 1997 the entire observational data processing suite was moved to
the CRAY-YMP machine
and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PREPOBS_PROFCQC</span>
was modified to run in all networks as part of the observational
PREPBUFR processing. It now read in reports from a PREPBUFR file,
performed quality
control, and wrote the updated reports (with &ldquo;events&rdquo;) to
an output PREPBUFR file. This
change introduced two major errors in the code which have just now been
discovered. First, the
program did not account for the fact that the upstream <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">PREPOBS_PREPDATA</span> program,
which
generates the PREPBUFR file, does not encode levels with missing wind
data. This has resulted
in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PREPOBS_PROFCQC</span>
performing incorrect temporal checks since the level index in data
arrays for a particular site does not necessarily refer to the same
height level across different time
periods. Secondly, the wind profiler heights in the PREPBUFR file are
height above sea level
rather than above ground. Since the increment, temporal and vertical
check error limits are based
on the fixed 43 level heights above ground, these are being assigned
incorrectly because of both
the level index problem and the conversion to height above sea-level.</p>
<br>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PREPOBS_PROFCQC</span> was
modified in 2001 to account for the increase in NPN report levels
from 43 to 64. All levels were then separated by 250 meters. This
change did not correct the
problems noted in the previous paragraph. </p>
<br>
<p>In May 2002, NOAA/NCEP began operational decoding and dumping of
wind profiler data from
both Cooperative Agency Profilers (CAP) and from the Japanese
Meteorological Agency (JMA). The CAP reports include the NOAA Boundary
Layer Profilers (BLP) as well as acoustic sounders (SODARs). Sites from
these platforms
report at levels different from the NPN sites, and the CAP sites can
report as often as every fifteen
minutes. The vertical profiles of heights above ground are not
necessarily the same from one
CAP profiler site to another and the vertical spacing of height levels
can vary at each particular
site. </p>
<br>
<p>These new types of profiler data, now being testing in the PREPBUFR
processing suite, have
necessitated a major revision in the current <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">PREPOBS_PROFCQC</span> program.
This revision has
not only uncovered the longstanding errors noted previously, but has
also offered the opportunity
to improve the quality control of wind profiler data from all
platforms. A summary of all changes
is provided next.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>Changes to correct errors in the existing code:</i></p>
<br>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>1.
The level index in all arrays is now site specific. This will allow
temporal checking to
be performed properly at each individual site. Each site is examined
over all report times in order
to generate a height profile containing all possible levels. Those
times with new levels inserted are
given missing wind coordinates. This change is even more important now
with the addition of
CAP and JMA reports where height levels can vary greatly from one time
to the next at a
particular site.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>2.
The increment, temporal, vertical and median check error limits are now
directly
associated with a reported height above ground level rather than with
the level index in the arrays. This ensures that the proper error limit
is used at all levels and it eliminates the height above
ground versus height above sea level discrepancy. As is the case in one
above, this correction is
even more important with the inclusion of CAP and JMA sites which
report wind data on height
levels which vary greatly from the standard levels found in the NPN
reports. The error limits
values themselves remain unchanged.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>3.
The subroutine which calculates and prints out statistics was not
computing kurtosis
(fourth moment) correctly.</p>
<br>
<p><i>Other changes to account for the addition of CAP and JMA profiler
reports:</i></p>
<br>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>1.
The maximum number of sites the code can process is increased from 40
to 120.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>2.
The number of time periods input to the code is now site specific
rather than being
hardwired to be the same for all reports.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>3.
The temporal check error limits are based on statistics from NPN
profilers which have
a minimum two-hour spanning time difference. Since most CAP sites
report every half- or
quarter-hour, these error limits are most likely too loose. The
temporal check logic is modified to
always attempt to use a two-hour spanning time difference for the CAP
sites if possible by
skipping intervening report times on each side of the central time if
they differ from the central
time by less than one hour. In cases where this is not possible, a time
difference of at least one
half-hour on one side is used. If this is not possible, then the
temporal check is not performed. The maximum time difference on one
side is two hours. </p>
<br>
<p><i>Other changes which improve the overall quality control
algorithms:</i></p>
<br>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>1.
In the current wind profiler processing suites, the dump and PREPBUFR
codes all use
the same time window radius as the assimilation. For the Global
Forecast System (GFS) this is
3.0 hours, for the Eta Data Assimilation System (Eta/EDAS) this is 1.5
hours, and for the Rapid
Update Cycle (RUC) this is 0.5 hours. This means that reports at the
assimilation time boundaries
are forced to use one-sided differencing in the temporal check. A
change is being made in the
upstream dump and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PREPOBS_PREPDATA</span>
codes to increase the time window radius by one
hour for all three networks. This will allow the temporal check to use
two-sided differences for
the assimilation time boundaries as well as for all in-between times.
New network-specific
namelist switches in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PREPOBS_PROFCQC</span>
will specify the assimilation time window and the
program will output only reports within this boundary. The code will
continue to run properly
with one-sided temporal differencing at the assimilating time
boundaries if no reports are available
beyond these times. In fact, in the RUC and Eta, the early cutoff times
will result in one-sided
differencing for the temporal check at the latest report time since it
will still be inside the
assimilation time window.</p>
<br>
<p><i>Other &ldquo;cosmetic&rdquo; changes:</i></p>
<br>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>1.
DOCBLOCKS and comments in the code are much more descriptive than
before.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>2.
DO-LOOP logic is more concise than before (especially in temporal and
vertical check
modules).</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>3.
Standard output is easier to read and more complete than before.
Excessive print of
differencing results is removed from operational runs with a new
namelist switch which controls
the degree of printout.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>4.
The quality marker change event &ldquo;reason code&rdquo; is expanded
(more about this later).</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>5.
Report level information in various output listings is expanded and
sorted into bins
containing both all data levels and only those levels containing either
suspect or bad quality
markers (either originally placed on the data by NOAA/FSL or placed on
the data in this code as a
quality control event). This output is written to text files but not
included in the standard output. (One listing of bad data levels is
concatenated to the standard output in operational runs.)</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>6.
Statistical output is clarified and is written to two text files
separate from the standard
output. The computation and printout of statistics can be bypassed (as
it will be in operations)
through a new namelist switch. The combination of statistic types
printed out (first through
fourth moment) is controlled by new namelist switches. Statistics are
generated separately for
reports from the NPN, CAP and JMA platforms and are stratified
according to height above
ground. For NPN and JMA reports, the levels correspond to their
standard height level spacing
(250 and 300 meters, respectively). Vertical levels for the CAP sites,
which report at different
spacings depending upon the site, are assigned to the nearest 50 meters
above ground level. These statistics may be useful to NCO in future
upgrades of their wind profiler quality monitoring. The statistics may
also be used to update the error check limits, in particular making
them
platform-specific and providing more resolution at high levels where
these values are currently
constant.</p>
<br>
<p><i>Changes that might be considered for the future:</i></p>
<br>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>1.
Since the vertical check error limits are based on the 250 and 1000
meter vertical level
spacings in the pre-2002 NPN reports, these should probably be modified
to be weighted by the
&ldquo;actual&rdquo; spanning level difference. The statistical output
could be helpful here.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>2.
This code was written at a time when the Regional OI-analysis was
operational. This
analysis benefited from having observed data at standard pressure
levels. The NPN wind profiler
data, like all other vertical profile upper-air reports, contained
auxiliary pressure levels at every 25
or 50 mb with interpolated winds. These were mixed in with the reported
height levels. The
changes made to update this program may not allow these auxiliary
levels to be handled properly. Of course, this is not a problem in the
current operational environment since these interpolated
levels are no longer included in any reports. Although highly unlikely,
there could be a case
where a historical rerun could encounter NPN reports with additional
pressure levels. Usually,
historical reruns run with current operational codes and scripts (e.g.,
the Regional Reanalysis). In
any event, it might be wise to test the updated <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">PREPOBS_PROFCQC</span> on an old
PREPBUFR file
containing wind profiler reports with auxiliary levels.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>3.
The RASS profile reports may be able to be quality controlled using a
form of the
program.</p>
<br>
<p><i>Expanded Reason Codes:</i></p>
<br>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
program and reason codes are included in the PREPBUFR file in order to
define all
quality control &ldquo;events&rdquo; performed on observations. The
program code defines which quality
control step performed the action while the reason code defines the
reason for the action. The
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">PREPOBS_PROFCQC</span>
program (known as the <i>CQCPROF</i> quality control step) is assigned
program code &ldquo;9". To date it provides only two reason codes:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> 3 - Wind
observation is found to be of questionable quality (wind quality marker
set to &ldquo;3" for suspect)</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">13 - Wind
observation failed quality control checks (wind quality marker set to
&ldquo;13" for bad)</span> . </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason code is now expanded to provide more information about
the nature of the quality
marker change. The reason code is defined as a three-digit number <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">XYZ</span>, where the value of each
digit has the following meaning:</p>
<br>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Hundredth&rsquo;s digit (<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">X</span>):</span></p>

- Median check and vertical check both suspect</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">5 - Median
check failed, vertical check did not fail (may have passed, may be
suspect, or may not be possible)</span></p>
