The "PREPBUFR" processing is the final step
in preparing the majority of conventional observational data for
assimilation into the
various NCEP analyses including the <a href="http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/?branch=NAM">North
American
Model (NAM)</a>
unified&nbsp;<a href="http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gmb/gdas/">grid-point

Data Assimilation System (CDAS) <span class="st">spectral statistical
interpolation (SSI) analysis</span></a><span class="st"> (the</span>
"CDAS" network). This step involves the
execution
of series of programs designed to assemble observations <a href="../data_dumping.doc/document.htm">dumped</a>
from a number of on-line decoder databases, encode information about
the
observational error for each data type as well the background (first
guess)
interpolated to each data location, perform both rudimentary
multi-platform
quality control and more complex platform-specific quality control, and
store the output in a monolithic <a href="http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/www/WDM/Guides/BUFRCREXGuide-English.html">BUFR</a>
file, known as PREPBUFR. The background guess information is used by
certain
quality control programs while the observation error is used by the
analysis
to weigh the observations. The structure of the BUFR file is such that
each PREPBUFR processing step which changes a datum (either the
observation
itself, or its quality marker) records the change as an "event" with a
program code and a reason code. Each time an event is stored, the
previous
events for the datum are "pushed down" in the stack. In this way, the
PREPBUFR
file contains a complete history of changes to the data throughout all
of the PREPBUFR processing. The most recent changes are always at the
top
of the stack and are thus read first by any subsequent data decoder
routine.
It is expected that the data at the top of the stack are of the highest
quality.
&nbsp;Once the PREPBUFR&nbsp;job has completed,&nbsp;a
separate
PREPBUFR post processing job
is
initiated.<br>

Purpose: To read in and consolidate
observations
dumped from individual BUFR DATA databases, perform rudimentary checks
on the data, and organize upper-air data by decreasing pressure. For
all
networks except the CDAS, and to some extent the RTMA and URMA, also
performs a
number of tasks under the name GBLEVENTS: 1) Adds forecast background
(first guess) interpolated
to each observation location; 2) Adds observational error (read in from
a
<a href="../obserror.htm" target="_blank">look-up table</a>)
to each
observation; 3) Performs some rough quality
control
checks on surface pressure (vs. the background);&nbsp;and 4)
Converts
dry bulb
temperature to virtual and dewpoint temperature to specific humidity
for
surface data. &nbsp;All of these GBLEVENTS functions
are&nbsp;performed
by the program <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="#prevents">PREPOBS_PREVENTS</a>
in the CDAS network. &nbsp;In the RTMA and URMA networks, the only
GBLEVENT
function performed is item&nbsp;4. &nbsp;Output is stored in a
monolithic BUFR file called
PREPBUFR.

Also reads in (based on the network) the global nemsio&nbsp;first guess

quality
control on the data are the rudimentary limit checks applied by this
program,
the checks of surface pressure observations compared to the background
(except for&nbsp;CDAS,&nbsp;RTMA and URMA network runs), and those <a href="../data_dumping.doc/document.htm#SDM">applied

(OPC)</a> on marine ship and buoy
data.
<br>





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note 1: In the NAM and
RAP networks,
the background used is the global nems first guess <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(subject to tropical
cyclone
relocation in the NAM&nbsp;network</span>.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">; Note: No longer in NAM after March
2017.</span>) This is only used by the
subsequent
quality control programs. No background is encoded in the RTMA or URMA
network
as no quality control programs are run here. Also, observational errors
are <i>not</i>
encoded
in the PREPBUFR file in the RAP,&nbsp;RTMA and URMA networks&nbsp;<a href="document.htm#1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note 2: In all networks except
the RTMA and URMA, this
program is multi-tasked amongst 3 nodes on the WCOSS&nbsp;machine to
speed
up processing time.&nbsp; In order to load-balance the run streams,
each
of the input data dump files in this case&nbsp;are divided into 3 equal parts by the
program
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PREPOBS_MPCOPYBUFR</span>.&nbsp;
This is analogous to a card game where all of the cards in the deck are
dealt out to 3 players.&nbsp; Next, <span style="font-weight: bold;">PREPOBS_PREPDATA</span>
runs in 3
parallel run streams, with each run using the mini-dump files as
input.&nbsp;
Each run stream uses all of the dump types, but for each type only
1/3<sup>rd</sup>
of the original dump is processed.&nbsp; A program called <span style="font-weight: bold;">PREPOBS_LISTHEADERS</span>
runs immediately after <span style="font-weight: bold;">PREPOBS_PREPDATA</span>
in run each stream, reordering
all message types in each "mini&rdquo; PREPBUFR file according to
that
specified
in the BUFR mnemonic table.&nbsp; This is necessary because when
all 3
run streams of <span style="font-weight: bold;">PREPOBS_MPCOPYBUFR</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold;">PREPOBS_PREPDATA</span>/
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PREPOBS_LISTHEADERS</span>
have completed, the program <span style="font-weight: bold;">PREPOBS_MONOPREPBUFR</span>
concatenates the
3 mini-PREPBUFR files into a monolithic PREPBUFR file ready for
subsequent
processing.<br>





&nbsp; &nbsp; Note 3: In all&nbsp;networks except for the CDAS,
the data read
in from the SATWND dump file and encoded into the PREPBUFR files is not
read by the subsequent&nbsp;analysis. &nbsp;Instead, the
GSI
reads in this same SATWND dump file directly and ignores the SATWND
data&nbsp;in the PREPBUFR files.</p>




<p><a name="1"></a><sup>1</sup>The observation errors encoded into the
PREPBUFR files (in the GFS/GDAS and NAM) are no longer read by the GSI.
&nbsp;Instead, the GSI reads observation errors (for all networks)
from&nbsp;an external file in the network fixed file directory.
&nbsp;However, the CDAS SSI still reads in the&nbsp;observation errors encoded into CDAS&nbsp;PREPBUFR file.</p>

Purpose: This runs only in the URMA&nbsp;network
to perform the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research
Laboratory&nbsp;(GLERL) adjustment to surface land and marine data
in&nbsp;the Great Lakes region. The goal is to create a smooth wind
analysis
over the Great Lakes that can be used to initialize the Great Lakes

as&nbsp;water temperature&nbsp;(if existing report is over water, new
report is over land and vice-versa).&nbsp; The original,
existing&nbsp;report is retained at its original location. Other
reports are moved from land to water&nbsp;(or vice versa) in order to
align properly with the RTMA land/sea mask over the&nbsp;Great Lakes

Purpose: Performs complex quality control
on
rawinsonde height and temperature data to identify or correct erroneous
observations that arise from location, transcription or communications
errors.&nbsp; Attempts are made, when appropriate, to correct
commonly
occurring types of errors.&nbsp; Erroneous data that cannot be
corrected
are flagged and will not be considered by the analyses.&nbsp; The
checks
used are: hydrostatic, increment, horizontal statistical, vertical
statistical,
temporal (in the CDAS network only), baseline and lapse rate. These
multiple
checks are based upon differences from the six-hour Global Data
Assimilation
System (GDAS) forecast (the usual background first guess).&nbsp;
This
program
also applies <a href="http://www.ncep.noaa.gov/officenotes/NOAA-NPM-NCEPON-0005/01408987.pdf">intersonde
(radiation) corrections</a> to the
quality
controlled
rawinsonde height and temperature data. The degree of correction is a
function
of the rawinsonde instrument type, the sun angle and the vertical
pressure
level. Finally, this program converts rawinsonde and dropwinsonde dry
bulb
temperature to virtual and rawinsonde and dropwinsonde dewpoint
temperature
to specific humidity.

Purpose: Performs an optimum interpolation
based quality control on the complete set of observations in the
PREPBUFR
file.&nbsp; As with the complex quality control procedures, this
program
operates in a parallel rather than a serial mode.&nbsp; That is, a
number
of independent checks (horizontal, vertical, geostrophic) are performed
using all admitted observations.&nbsp; Each observation is
subjected to
the optimum interpolation formalism using all observations except
itself
in each check.&nbsp; A final quality decision (keep, toss, or
reduced
confidence
weight) is made based on the results from all prior platform-specific
quality
checks (see B.-I. above) and from any <a href="http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/data_processing/data_dumping.doc/document.htm#SDM">manual</a>
quality marks attached to the data.&nbsp; The results from all the
checks
are kept in an annotated observational database.&nbsp; One other
responsibility
of this program is to perform a multivariate surface wind analysis and
assign the analyzed direction to the SSM/I oceanic wind speed
observation
in order to produce a wind vector for these data.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE PREPBUFR FILE</u></b>
<br>





&nbsp;
</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">PREPOBS_PREPDATA</span>
program reads in a BUFR
table text file which lays out the BUFR descriptors and their defined
sequence
for each type of report. Every descriptor and sequence is represented
by
a unique mnemonic in order to make the NCEP form of BUFR more
user-friendly.
This BUFR table is stored in the first messages of the output PREPBUFR
file. The PREPBUFR file is thus self-defining - all subsequent codes
that
read it are able to parse the table directly out of the PREPBUFR file
itself.
The current BUFR mnemonic table is found in <a href="table_1.htm">Table
1.a-1.e.</a>
</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The highest level mnemonic sequences in the
PREPBUFR file are known as the "Table A Entries" because they refer to
a unique <a href="../bufrtab_tablea.htm">BUFR
Table A</a> data
category as defined in Section 1 of the BUFR
message. These mnemonic sequences will be referred to as PREPBUFR
"message
types". See <a href="table_1.htm">Table
1.a</a> for the current list of
message types along with their number
(BUFR
descriptor) and description. The last 3 digits in the descriptor number
are the Table A data entries in Section 1.
</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each PREPBUFR message type consists of
either
mnemonic sequences known as "<a href="../bufrtab_tabled.htm">Table D</a>"
entries, or mnemonics
representing
a single datum known as "<a href="../bufrtab_tableb.htm">Table B</a>"
entries. Each Table D sequence
consists
of either other Table D sequences or of Table B data descriptors. Thus,
every PREPBUFR message type can be broken down finer and finer until it
consists of a string of Table B descriptors. See <a href="table_1.htm#b">Table
1.b</a> for the current list of
Table D entries, their descriptor
number
and description. <a href="table_1.htm#c">Table
1.c</a> contains the current list of
Table B entries along with their
descriptor
number and description.
<a href="table_1.htm#c">Table
1.c</a> also contains the scaling,
reference value, number of bits and
units associated with each Table B entry.
</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The current layout of Table D and Table B
entries
that comprise each report by PREPBUFR message type is shown in <a href="table_1.htm#d">Table
1.d</a>. There are special
characters around some of the Table D
sequences
in <a href="table_1.htm#d">Table
1.d</a>. These refer to replication
descriptors.
</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Curly
brackets
"{" and "}" around a sequence mnemonic indicate that 8-bit delayed
replication
is possible on the sequence. This is generally found for sequences
which
replicate as levels, such as in upper-air data. The replication is
delayed
because the number of levels is not known ahead of time.
&nbsp;There is
a maximum of 255 replicated levels here.</p>





<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Parentheses&nbsp;"(" and ")"
around a sequence mnemonic indicate that 16-bit delayed replication
is possible on the sequence. This is generally found for sequences
which
replicate as radiance channels, such as in AIRS 1B satellite
radiance&nbsp;data. The replication is delayed
because the number of levels is not known ahead of time.
&nbsp;There is
a maximum of 65535 replicated levels here.
</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Angle
brackets
"&lt;" and "&gt;" around a sequence indicate that a 1-bit
replication
descriptor
is acting on this sequence. If every Table B descriptor in the sequence
is missing, then only one bit is needed to represent the data (and the
bit is set to zero). If one or more Table B descriptors in the sequence
are present, the bit is set to one indicating that all of the Table B
descriptors
in the sequence are represented bit-wise. This is useful for sequences
which may often be missing, since only one bit is needed in this case.
</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Square
brackets
"[" and "]" around a sequence indicate that this sequence is subset to
events stacking. Here, the replication is the number of events
associated
with the sequence. Recall from the first paragraph of this document
that
the PREPBUFR file is structured such that each PREPBUFR processing step
which changes a datum (either the observation itself, or its quality
marker)
records the change as an "event" with a program code and a reason code.
Each time an event is stored, the previous events for the datum are
"pushed
down" in the stack. In this way, the PREPBUFR file contains a complete
history of changes to the data throughout all of the PREPBUFR
processing.
<a href="table_1.htm#d">Table
1d </a>shows that square brackets
are only found around sequences
which
consist the observation value itself (either pressure, specific
humidity,
temperature, height wind, and total or layer precipitable water), the
observation
value's quality marker, the program code for the event changing either
the observation or its quality marker and the reason code within this
program
code. &nbsp;There is a maximum of 255 replicated events here.
</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="table_1.htm#e">Table
1.e</a> contains the list of Table D
entries that define the PREPBUFR
processing
steps that can act to generate events. It should be noted that a step
is
not necessarily the same as a program here. Some programs consist of
more
than one step, while some steps can appear in more than one program.
The
description defines the program(s) associated with each Table D entry
here.
The "program code" mentioned in the previous paragraph is unique for a
particular step here and is determined by the last 3 digits in the
descriptor
number.
</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The PREPBUFR file contains a number of
Table B
entries which are code or flag tables (see <a href="table_1.htm#c">Table
1.c</a>).&nbsp;
Links are provided to web pages which define these tables. &nbsp;In
general, the code and flag tables for those variables defined with WMO
descriptors
can be found in the <a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/WMOCodes/WMO306_vI2/LatestVERSION/WMO306_vI2_BUFRCREX_CodeFlag_en.pdf">WMO
BUFR Code and Flag Tables</a>

Code Tables</a>.
&nbsp;The&nbsp;code&nbsp;tables for
most of the more common variables
defined with local descriptors&nbsp;are discussed
next.
</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The reports in the PREPBUFR file are
differentiated
by both the PREPBUFR report type (mnemonic &ldquo;TYP&rdquo; in
the
PREPBUFR file)
and by an input "dump" report type, loosely based on the obsolete <a href="http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/data_processing/on29.htm">NMC
Office Note 29</a> and <a href="http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/data_processing/on124.htm">NMC
Office Note 124</a> report types
(mnemonic &ldquo;T29" in the PREPBUFR
file).&nbsp;
Reports are split into mass and wind pieces at the current
time.&nbsp;
All mass reports contain PREPBUFR report types in the range 100-199,
while
all wind reports contain PREPBUFR report types in the range
200-299.&nbsp;
These report types are used by the various assimilation systems to
identify
the reports in the PREPBUFR file.&nbsp; <a href="table_2.htm">Table
2</a>,
<a href="table_3.htm">Table
3</a>, <a href="table_4.htm">Table

5</a>
and <a href="table_19.htm">Table
19</a> contain the code tables of
PREPBUFR report types currently valid
in the GFS/GDAS, CDAS, NAM, RAP and RTMA/URMA networks,
respectively.&nbsp;

each PREPBUFR report&nbsp;type can be found <a href="PREPBUFR_obs_usage_GBL-GSI,_ops.doc">HERE

for the NAM</a> <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">(Note: this information may need to be updated)</span>. &nbsp;The
input "dump" report type defines the report more precisely than the
PREPBUFR report
type (e.g., PREPBUFR report type 180 consists of marine ship, buoy and
C-MAN platform reports, all of which contain a unique input report
type).
<a href="table_6.htm">Table
6</a> defines the code table of
input "dump" report types (the same
for all networks).&nbsp; The input report type is not used by any
assimilation
system at the current time.
</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most of the observation types in the
PREPBUFR
file are associated with quality markers (e.g., mnemonics
&ldquo;PQM,
&ldquo;TQM&rdquo;,
&ldquo;WQM&rdquo;, etc.).&nbsp; These are used by the
various analyses
to place a weight
on the data based on its quality.&nbsp; <a href="table_7.htm">Table

quality markers.&nbsp; These quality
markers
apply to all observation types in the PREPBUFR file.

associated with a particular program code
(e.g., mnemonics &ldquo;PRC&rdquo;, &ldquo;TRC&rdquo;,

The NAM,&nbsp;GFS/GDAS,&nbsp;RAP and RTMA/URMA GSI
analyses&nbsp;also&nbsp;assimilate (or at least monitor)
many&nbsp;observation types&nbsp;directly from their BUFR dump files or
from
other non-PREPBUFR sources. Such&nbsp;types include satellite
radiances
(including RARS and DBRTN), satellite retrieved products
(including ozone and GOES cloud data
from NESDIS and LaRC), GPS radio occultation, WSR-88D NEXRAD radial
wind data,&nbsp;lightning and satellite-derived winds and other
products.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u>5.&nbsp;
EXAMPLE PROGRAM TO DECODE NCEP PREPBUFR FILES</u></b>
<br>





&nbsp;
</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A sample program at <a href="decode_prepbufr_example.htm">http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/data_processing/prepbufr.doc/decode_prepbufr_example</a>
demonstrates how the contents of the PREPBUFR file can be decoded using
routines in the NCEP BUFR library.&nbsp; In this particular
example,&nbsp;
every report is decoded and listed to output files specific to the BUFR
Table A message type.&nbsp; This program also merges the mass and
wind
report "pieces" into a common output report for listing.&nbsp; In
subroutine
<b>READPB</b>,
there is a logical variable <b><i><a href="decode_prepbufr_example.htm#single_msgtyp">single_msgtyp</a></i></b>
which controls the amount of processing.&nbsp; If it is set to <b>FALSE</b>,
then the entire PREPBUFR file is decoded.&nbsp; If it is set to <b>TRUE</b>,
then only reports in the Table A message type indicated by the variable
<b><i><a href="decode_prepbufr_example.htm#msgtyp_process">msgtyp_process</a></i></b>
are decoded.&nbsp;</p>

POST-PROCESSING OF NCEP PREPBUFR FILES</u></b>
<br>





&nbsp;
</p>





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
completion of the PREPBUFR&nbsp;job triggers a job
which
performs
post-processing
on the PREPBUFR&nbsp;files just created.&nbsp; This job does
not
produce
any
output necessary to the successful completion of the analysis/forecast
network (indeed,&nbsp;it runs either simultaneously with, or
after,&nbsp;the analysis job<a href="http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/data_processing/prepbufr.doc/document.htm"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"></span></a>
which is also
triggered by the completion of the
PREPBUFR&nbsp;job). <span ="">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;The
first job step&nbsp;executes the program BUFR_REMOREST
which
removes or masks,
from the PREPBUFR&nbsp;file, certain data types that are restricted
(either by the data producers themselves or by the WMO) from
redistribution
outside of NCEP.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/sib/restricted_data/restricted_data_pmb/"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">
NCEP/NCO

restricted
data</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The
resulting PREPBUFR&nbsp;file, gleaned of all
restricted
data, is&nbsp;given a suffix qualifier of&nbsp; ".nr" in the
network-specific
/com directories on the NCEP-WCOSS.<span =""></span></p>





<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;The

"TimeTwins" (duplications in current rawinsonde, pibal
or&nbsp;dropwinsonde wind report "parts" vs. those over
the&nbsp;past
35 days). &nbsp;This is only executed in the GDAS network (but for
every cycle).</p>





<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;The next job step reformats&nbsp;received,
selected, and assimilated data counts (for both&nbsp;satellite and
non-satellite types) for all four GDAS
network&nbsp;cycles&nbsp;for the
current day and&nbsp;saves the&nbsp;result in the monthly
